["\" seven \" is one of the best mystery movies i've ever seen. \nit's extremely intriguing and suspenseful, but it's also quite fun. \nit's a serial killer mystery, but you don't care so much about

\" celebrity, \" range from terribly boring to just so-so, my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of \" manhattan, \" my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time. \nwoody allen's films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair, so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand-in-hand ( \" manhattan \" really is one of the best-looking films i've ever seen, beautiful black and white photography of the city's best areas, etc. ), a fan can't help but feel visibly moved. \nthe film opens up, with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds, and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack, but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky, with the word \" help \" being spelled with an airplane. \nbeethoven's 5th blasts on the soundtrack. \nthe city seems to stop to take notice of this moment, and it's all rather lovely to look at","an astonishingly difficult movie to watch, the last temptation of = christ may be scorsese's most important film, and yet his most = impossibly abstract as well. \nscorsese presents the life of jesus = christ, through nikos kazantzakis' novel, which details the life of = christ from approximately 20 until the day of crucifixtion. \njesus of = nazareth ( dafoe ) is a carpenter, who opens the film making crosses, so

that he can reach = god. \nbefore leaving, he asks for forgiveness from mary magdelene = ( barbara hershey ), a prostitute who is also a childhood friend of jesus","call me crazy, but i don't see saving private ryan as the film of the summer. \na good movie, yes, with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare. \nan utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielberg's best work, no. \npersonally, if i was spielberg, i wouldn't go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindler's list and the indiana jones movies. \ni'm guessing steve has a thing for nazis ; i really wouldn't be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastika-wearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie. \nall lofty pretenses aside, saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of a 1980s slasher flick. \nthe difference is, it's easy during friday the 13th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacon's chest while blood spurts like crazy, but it's damn hard to sit and eat

rotterdam, ny ), theater #6, by myself for free using my sony\/loews critic's pass. \n[theater rating : * * * : good seats, sound, and picture] \nwar is a topic that can't help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media. \nmovies, documentaries, and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on, such as strategy, politics, and victory. \nit's easy to forget war, in its most basic form, is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other. \nforgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier, no matter what his rank or importance, is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number","'lake placid' is definately not your typical creature attacking people movie, ok so maybe it is, but this one is enjoyable, and clever. \nactually it comes off more of a comedy than a horror film. \nwell the ending is kinda scary, but in most horror\/comedies they are. \ni will admit that 'lake placid' isn't an oscar worthy film, but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and funny. \nbridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating, is forced to go to lake

ripped to shreds ? \nis it where a person is being chased by some damned teenager who wants revenge ? \npossibly its some guy with a hook who wants to know what you did last summer. \nwhat ever happened to horror movies, where the horror was in the atmosphere, and in the characters. \nmovies like \" halloween \" and \" psycho \" which revolutionized horror genre forever, but wait in 1973

fifth element, and to this, sci-fi\/horror that is event horizon. \n ( more is on the way with contact and alien : ressurection being released later this year. ) \nthe story is thus : in 2040 an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out a newly invented gravity drive. \na device that enables a craft to travel anywhere in the universe, instantaneously. \nthis is achieved by creating a gateway, infact, a black hole, between the craft and it's required destination. \nin this case, from near neptune to proxima prime. \nhowever, when the event horizon attempts this, it dissappears, without trace, leaving two searches for it fruitless","scarface, a remake of the 1932 film of the same name, is a very gripping and, as far as i know, a true-to-life story of how power and violence lead to corruption. \nal pacino, as tony montana ( for whom the movie is named ), also provides a brilliant performance as a cuban refugee who comes to america with less than nothing and becomes one of the most highly respected and feared drug lords in miami. \noliver stone also penned the screenplay in one of his earlier writing roles. \nthe film begins by disclosing the story of now fidel castro ordered thousands of cubans to set sail and head for the coasts of the united states. \nmany of these cubans had criminal records, such as tony montana, a cocky, fast-talking man who has the look of crime. \nnearly right after his arrival in miami, tony is thrust into the gangster life when he participates in a cocaine buy that goes awry. \nalong with his friend and partner, manolo ( steven bauer ), tony rises in the gangster ranks when he forms a friendship with frank lopez ( robert loggia ), a high-roller in the organized crime field","trekkies, roger nygard's energetic and hilarious documentary, brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions. \nthe beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike. \n ( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs. trekker polemic as not worth arguing about. ) \nthe good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable, loud giggles, yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe","if you're the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland, you're going to love the hunt for red october. \nyou'll also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics, or if you're a sean connery or alec baldwin fan, or if you admired director john mctiernan's earlier films, die hard and predator. \nin fact, the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book, since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them. \nthe hunt for red october is an epic thriller, adapted from tom clancy's best selling novel. \nset in an era before glasnost, the movie revolves around a top-secret soviet submarine, called the red october","i was pleasantly surprised by this film. \nwith a budget topping $200 million, i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see. \nhow much could you dress up the sets ? \nhow many models and computer effects could you use ? \nhow much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ? \noh, if i've just given away part of the plot for you, go back to school. \nafter having viewed titanic, however, i found it to be a well-paced, well-designed, and overall well-made movie. \nthere have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic, but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i've seen. \ntitanic tells its story in two time periods. \nit starts out in the present, when ocean explorer brock lovett ( bill paxton ) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic, searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship","it was easy to fear the worst. \nbegin with a classic 1960's television series, add a big budget and an a-list

hair out over what it means. \" \nit took him sixteen words to do as whole dissertations have tried and failed : equate god and abstract art and offer a kind of backhanded comfort to those confused to the point of resentment by the concept. \nthe biopic _pollock_, actor ed harris' directorial debut, reflects the second soundbite in how it accepts pollock's creations as part of the order of things, and should similarly disarm haters of fine art. \narguably more than any other living actor, harris, who also plays _pollock_, embodies the archetypal working stiff, and his blue-collar demystification of pollock's labour-intensive art, both as performer and director, makes for unpretentious cinema. \n ( from what i know of harris, he, like pollock, was not born gifted or lucky ; instead, a strong work ethic is the seed of his success","it's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast. \nsure, there have been delightful outings like last years hercules. \nbut nothing entirely groundbreaking. \nwith the release of the studio's newest feature length film, a remake of edgar rice burrough's creation tarzan, disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques. \nit's no classic, but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be. \nthe plot is loyal to the original storyline, as tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire, and find shelter in the jungles of africa. \nbut, they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor, leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib","warning : if you actually wish to see the film, stop reading this and see it. \nwhile i don't blow any plot details, the more you know about a movie, the more disappointing and built up it becomes ( waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing ). \nbut, in a nutshell, it's a good film. \nstar wars episode i : the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim \nnever having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world ( i was more into star trek : the next generation ), it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment, the phantom menace. \nhowever, it can't be ignored","it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system. \nno major surprise, when j. s. mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either. \nthe americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist, the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority. \nsmall wonder that hollywood's most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual-underdog against some larger collective oppressive - witness braveheart, born on the fourth of july, rocky, first blood, clear and present danger, jfk, the list goes on","the ring is probably one of the creepiest movies i've seen in years. \nbut then again, i've always had this phobia of asian born horror films. \ni remember when i was a kid i was scared as hell with those green faced, long-haired floating ghosts donning their white gowns\u0005\u0005euuugh. \nthe ring really brings back those memories and its grips me long after the movie has ended. \nunlike the horror films coming from the west, i'm pretty much used to the gore and visual effects, so much so, they become rather bland nowadays. \nthere's really no scary movie from the west for a long time","deep rising is one of \" those \" movies. \nthe kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us. \nit does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god... screw that, it says boldly, let's see some computer generated monsters rip into, decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors","vampire films, as well as other horror films, are usually dumb and predictable b-movies, meant to scare us by cliches and simple shocks. \nit is therefore interesting to watch neil jordans recent film that is not only visually stunning, but has also a plot worth making movies about. \nbased on anne rice's novel, \" interview with a vampire \" is a long, dark trip to hell. \nthe film opens with gothic quire and dark streets of

a take home hit. \nso it was in our family when we wandered over to the classic section of our local video store the other day and picked up a copy of the adventures of robin hood, a high spirited version of the walter scott story. \nnominated for the 1938 academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngold's melodramatic music, ralph dawson's fast paced

both children and adults. \nsteven spielberg may not have directed ( he only executive produced ) but his touch certainly is evident in this movie. \nand he knows a money making winner when he sees

it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to. \neveryone feels that they are different in some way, that they don't belong in some places and \" rebel without a cause \" successfully shows on screen these universal emotions. \nno matter what generation you belong to, these feelings are present. \nthis is why james dean is admired by america, because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute. \nin our minds, we just try to do the right thing just like dean's jim stark does. \nnot only does \" rebel without a cause \" display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure","david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director. \nwith his distinctive, more often than not ingenious dialogue, and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible. \nsome of them tend to be thickly layered, deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message, or sometimes even a concealed storyline. \nand although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors, it is still a brilliantly complex, consistently riveting motion picture about honor, about sacrifice, and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right. \noh, and it's rated g. \nincidentally, this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else's work ; namely a play by terrence rattigan, set in the 19th century","catherine deane ( jennifer lopez ) is a psychologist who has been

key part of the voice of moses, most people's first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer ( the saint and the island of dr. \nmoreau ), but he was dreamworks's choice in their first traditionally animated movie, the prince of egypt. \nthe selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one, but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasn't in the casting department. \nthe radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic, a la cecil b. demille, to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones. \nin the press kit

the devil \" is a challenging film, munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot, perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist's psyche rather than the artist's lifeline. \nwatching it, i was enthralled with the look of the film, the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre, personalized filter. \neverything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon, the film's subject, looked at it personally. \nbut while i was engrossed, i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film, awakened from my trance by some inner distraction, and began to try and follow what's going on. \nexactly what was i looking at ? \nwatching this film, i wasn't sure if it was the most insightful film i had

many ways, this debate could go either way. \napocalypse now is probably one of the most memorable vietnam war films ever made. \nin addition, now film has gone to the extremes that this film does - a disturbing look at the corruption and terrifying effects of the most devastating war of recent years","sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to. \nit's not the time or the distance, it's the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy. \nyet somehow, the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story. \nthe wings of the dove fits the pattern. \nkate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love. \nmerton, a newspaper writer, would like to marry kate. \nbut kate's \" job

this year, the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics. \na real charmer of a movie, it's possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience. \nnow, at the end of 1998, comes waking ned devine, a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter. \nthere's no substantial difference between the two other than a more refined atmosphere -- they strike all the same chords -- but still, ned devine is a movie worth seeing. \nthe plot is interesting and robust : the latest lottery winner is ned devine ( jimmy keogh ), of tullymore, ireland. \nned's prize is over six million pounds, but the shock of winning killed the poor old man, and the check remains unclaimed. \nenter jackie o'shea ( ian

and christmas, the reissue of the nightmare before christmas couldn't be more appropriate. \nwith all of the attention thrown to \" family films \" in recent years, namely those starring pocket monsters and nickelodeon characters, it's high time we raised the intellectual level of children's fare as well as the animation achievements of the movie studios. \nwith that in mind, it was refreshing to revisit an animation classic on the big screen that still retains the originality and freshness it had seven years ago. \nnightmare is the story of one man's quest to discover his true purpose in life -- to look beyond the accolades of his peers, the achievements of his years, and the praise of his ego. \njack skellington, the pumpkin king of halloweentown, is the main dude behind the halloween holiday for kids everywhere. \nbut during his reign as pumpkin king, jack has somehow lost his understanding of his place in the world and the magic he creates with his halloween holiday. \nafter the completion of one particular halloween season, jack walks with a heavy heart and ends up discovering in the woods outside halloweentown a grove of trees with doors to all of the other holidays in the world","every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre : with dramas, it was citizen kane, with arthouse it was pulp fiction, and with comedy it was, well, that jim carrey guy ( okay, so he's not a movie, but he did have a huge influence on the genre. \nnot to mention an expensive one. ) \nsometimes a movie even combines them all into a big, sprawling motion picture event, as did forrest gump four years ago. \nwith action films, it was aliens, whic was released to much hype seven years after it's equally-innovative parent, alien ( 1979 ). \ndirected and written by james cameron ( t2 : judgement day, the abyss, true lies ), the authority on action films, it was a masterful encore to his sci-fi thriller the terminator ( 1984 )","in 1995, brian singer and christopher mcquarrie dreamed up a simple concept : the audience isn't stupid. \nfrom that, they went on and created the most plot-driven, intricately pieced movie in the last 25

\" leila, \" a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui, that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u. s. distribution, thanks to first run features. \nalthough unfamiliar with mehrjui's previous directing efforts, perhaps the reason for this is that, while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country, the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers. \nset in modern-day iran, \" leila \" begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ), after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband, reza ( ali mosaffa )","barely scrapping by playing at a nyc piano bar, timothy hutton returns to his massachusetts hometown for a couple of weeks. \non the surface, he's coming home for a high school reunion, but since this is a movie, you know that he's really looking for some major life decisions. \na fairly \" small \" film, this sports an impressive ensemble cast including uma thurman, rosie o'donnell and a bunch of actors that you've seen before but can't quite place. \ncommendable jobs all around ; they seem like real people. \nhutton arrives at his past and is greeted by his spirit-dead father, terminally goony brother and old high school chums. \nall of his old

\nin truth, our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains. \nwhat we see, what we do, everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence. \nour bodies, severely atrophied, are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet. \nthe sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along","one of kyle mclachlan's earlier cinematic features, this movie has had an obvious influence on such films as the terminator ( 8\/10 ), species ( 7\/10 ) and the more recent, fallen with denzel washington. \nplot : a science-fiction picture set in modern times, this thriller follows the exploits of an \" entity \" from outer space, who likes to inhabit human bodies, use them up until they are completely worn out, and then switch over to the next available receptacle. \nfbi agent ( mclachlan ) and local top cop ( nouri ) are charged with the capture of this \" thing \" before it's too late. \ncritique : this fast-paced, urban equivalent of the thing ( 8\/10 ), checks in on all cylinders for ultra-violence ( god knows how many people died in this movie ), action and an overall rock 'n roll attitude. \nthen again, how can you go wrong with an \" alien \" that likes the ferraris, guns, heavy metal music and sexy girls ? ! \ngranted, the plot isn't the most elaborate of tales ( alien bad, find alien, kill alien ), but i can honestly say that i was never once bored during the viewing of this entire picture","i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean's war picture. \ni still think that it doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies. \nand i think that lumet's \" 12 angry men \", wilder's \" witness for the prosecution \" and kubrick's \" paths of glory \" would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958. \nbut i can't deny the importance of \" the bridge on the river

momentous railway bridge over the river kwai","of the major horror sub-genres, vampire movies are easily the most adaptable. \nthink about it. \nfrankenstein movies haven't changed all that much because they still need that mad-scientist-in-bavarian-castle setting. \nif you made a frankenstein movie today, you'd have to have the monster be a virus or something -- and outside of michael j. fox, there aren't any actors that could play a virus convincingly. \nmovies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt. \nthere's not much you can do with werewolves except take them to london or paris, unless you want to have a teenage werewolf or something","when quentin tarantino made \" pulp fiction \", he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s ; he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time. \nbut before you send me hate-mail for not giving that title to \" citizen kane \", hear me out. \nmuch like \" citizen kane \", \" pulp fiction \" has changed movie making forever. \nbut i think the latter has had a tad more impact. \n \" pulp fiction \" has actually ushered in a new era of film making. \nit has altered the way films will be viewed. \n \" fiction \" has spawned so many imitations, i've lost count. \nsure, some have been excellent ( \" bound \" and \" the usual suspects \" spring immediately to mind ), but any serious movie-goer recognizes \" pulp fiction \" as the original neo-noir of the 90s","there's some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably shouldn't and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did. \n \" lucky numbers \" is a perfect example of this because it's such a blatant rip-off of \" fargo \" and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me. \ni know i'm in the minority here but let me explain. \nthe film takes place in harrisburg, pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter. \njohn travolta plays the local big-shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards. \nruss is married to crystal ( lisa kudrow ), a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema","this summer, one of the most racially charged novels in john grisham's series, a time to kill, was made into a major motion picture. \non january 3 of this year, director rob reiner basically re-released the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi. \nbased on the true story of 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars' assassination, ghosts of mississippi revolves around the 25-year legal battle faced by myrlie evars ( whoopi goldberg, sister act ) and her quest to have her husband's obvious assassin and racist byron de la beckwith ( james woods, casino ) jailed. \nso she turns to assistant district attorney and prosecutor bobby delaughter ( alec baldwin, heaven's prisoners ) to imprison the former kkk member. \nghosts sets its tone with an opening montage of images from african-american history, from slave-ship miseries to life in the racist south of the 1960's. \nbut all too soon, the white folks take over, intoning lines like \" what's america got to do with anything ? \nthis is mississippi ! \" \nas beckwith, james woods, with his head larded with latex most of the time as an old man, teeters between portraying evil and its character. \nmeanwhile, goldberg turns in a very serious and weepy performance as the wife who wouldn't let her husband's death rest until she got the conviction. \nboth deserve serious oscar-consideration","towards the middle of \" the sweet hereafter, \" a crowded school bus skids on an icy road surface as it rounds a bend, careens through the steel guard rail, and disappears out of sight. \nthen, in long shot, we see the vehicle slowly sliding across what looks like a snow-covered field. \nit pauses for a moment before the \" field \" cracks under the bus' weight and the bright yellow vehicle vanishes in an effortless moment, a single smooth second of time. \ncompare that scene, if you will, to the last eighty minutes of \" titanic, \" when the behemoth sinks slowly and spectacularly to its watery demise, and you'll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films. \nthe scene in \" the sweet hereafter \" epitomizes all that's right with independent canadian director atom egoyan's film. \nit's not sensational. \nwe don't see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming, terrified children being bloodied and battered about","losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing. \nreacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare. \nwhile we all might feel the desire to blow someone's head off with a shotgun when they don't seem to grasp our point of view, actually threatening them with one is usually something we avoid. \nthis isn't the case with sam baily - john travolta's slightly askew average-joe persona in mad city. \n \" i don't think people listen to guys like me, \" sam laments during an exclusive interview from behind the walls of a museum","as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it, the more pleased i was when i left. \nfirst, getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : \" if you liked scream, you'll love wild things ! \" \n \" campbell gives a stunning performance ! \" \n \" this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days ! \" \n ( oh yeah, the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me ) \nnow, onto more serious stuff ( and with this film, i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way ). \nwild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa. \ni'm not saying that in a bad way, but when you see this film, you may be shocked by what you see. \nhowever, perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film's charming cast and tricky plot, that they let the film slide with an r rating. \nbeing mormon, i'm bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film. \ntrouble is, i have already seen it. \nand i like it ! \nwild things is a film noir of the 90s, filled with 40s sensibilities, and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture","the postman delivers but not first class \nthe postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman \n[warning : my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons : post-apocalypse stories, hope in a desperate situation, grassroots uprisings and kevin costner. \neven worse, i thought that \" waterworld \" was watchable. \nread the following with those particular grains of salt. ] \nit's the year 2013 and things have fallen apart. \ndue to a world war in the late nineties, the resulting three-year winter and a devastating plague, life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms","there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have, but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason. \n \" good will hunting \" is about one of those people. \nthe will hunting of the ( horrible ) title ( let's face it, this film would be a bitch to title ), played by co-writer matt damon, is a mathematical genius. \nhe can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino. \nand he works at mit... as the janitor","i guess it's a credit to jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour 2 could not be ruined even by the nauseating \" comedy \" of chris tucker. \ni'm a fan of jackie chan in just about any medium, and this movie lets him not only do his impressive-as-ever martial arts schtick, but show off his comic timing as well. \nit would have worked better if he was the only name above the title. \nthe plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effects. \nthis time around, the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan ( john lone ), who makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into the united states ( i'm still not sure how you can make a fortune doing that : is there a place where one can exchange fake bills for real ones ? ). \nthe only way to tell the phony money from the genuine article is to set it on fire and see what color it burns. \nof course, it's up to hong kong detective lee ( chan ) and trash-talking lapd detective james carter ( tucker ) to take the bad guys out and the authorities, to the extent that they even exist, stay out of their way","some critics, including siskel & ebert, are on the record stating that martin scorsese's raging bull, the story of boxer jake la motta, is the best film of the '80s. \nsince there are still a number of '80s films that i haven't seen, i don't feel qualified to make such a judgment, but i'll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture, and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1, 1980 and december 31, 1989 come close to its level. \nbio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry, dull textbook account. \nit's rare that a movie with the moniker \" based on the life of ? \" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining. \nraging bull is the perfect counterexample, and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre","much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of \" lolita, \" made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made, over its use of pedophilia, and as such, it's important to address it straight-forwardly, before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed, as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years, lying around in vaults san a distributor, and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit. \nwhen seeing this film, after all the hoopla, keeping in mind that there are people, namely me, who are fans of the novel, who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation... well, \nyou just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution. \nwhat's even worse is that seeing this \" lolita, \" especially the first time and if you're familiar with anything \" lolita, \" is admittingly very anticlimactic","capsule : side-splitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through to the end... \nbut not without providing a good deal of genuine laughs. \nmost comedies these days have one flaw. \nthey're not funny. \nthey think they're funny, but they are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly","maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it's not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month, because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker, broadcasted on abc on a monday night, starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth, respectively. \nbecause it's not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why it's so great. \nunderneath the to-die-for cinematography, the brilliant acting, and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty, not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it, tell it in a certain original way. \nit doesn't merely go from plot point to plot point. \nit goes from character to character","as i write the review for the new hanks\/ryan romantic comedy you've got mail, i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet. \ni am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world's biggest paid commercial for america online. \nand i wonder : is that so bad ? \nwell, the commercial part is. \nas for the movie, well, as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan, i think i'll be okay. \nto paraphrase james berardinelli, whose reviews i admire very much, tom hanks and meg ryan can act. \nthey are both wonderful, but for all of hanks' glorious work in serious films, such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan, and his glorious triumph in philadelphia, i like him best when he's suitably obnoxious","are we victims of fate in life or can we create our own destiny ? \ndirector\/writer brad anderson seems to be saying yes to both questions in his witty film \" next stop wonderland \". \nthe two main characters, alan and erin, spend the entire movie in each other's orbit, catching glimpses of one another, yet not quite connecting until the inevitable conclusion. \nis it fate that keeps them near each other and ultimately puts them together ? \ndoes this predestination carry over to all aspects of life ? \nas the film starts, erin castleton ( hope davis ), a melancholy 29- year old late shift nurse, is ending her live-in relationship with her boyfriend ( hoffman ). \nrather, he is ending it with her. \narriving home from work, erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of their apartment, car packed with his belongings. \nin a fumbling, amusing and self deluding ramble, he instructs erin to watch a videotape he's made detailing why their relationship is doomed to fail and why he's leaving. \nit's obvious he lacks the courage to confront her directly as he rails on about accomplishing something with his life and taking a stand, all the while backpedaling his way out of their relationship. \nhe then flees the scene with the grace of an inept thief","i'm an avid fan of the \" alien \" saga, so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it ). \nof course, that doesn't mean that i'm gonna be giving this a four-star review or something, because \" alien : resurrection, \" the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film, much like the first two were. \nhowever, it's a very good film which never fails to entertain, and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series. \nin short, i had a good time. \n \" alien : resurrection \" leaves off 200 years after the last one, where our heroine protagonist, ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ), the science fiction genre's answer to job, had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body, waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one. \nof course, the last one wasn't very great or anything ( i liked it, though not as much as the first two ), and more importantly, it wasn't financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! )","it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship, a green ovular pin, and the birth of oscar wilde, but if one really strains, they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off. \nwilde's philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature, and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned, loosing his family and his career. \nthe glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise. \nthe main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality ), they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else. \nand that's why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began. \nit's been said that todd haynes' \" velvet goldmine, \" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement, not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it, steals a lot from \" citizen kane, \" and that's true","when i first heard that romeo & juliet had been \" updated \" i shuddered. \ni thought that yet another of shakespeare's classics had been destroyed. \nfortunately, i was wrong. \nbaz luhrman has directed an \" in your face \", and visually stunning piece with this film. \nit revolves around the two rival families, who in this version each run multi-million dollar enterprises. \nthese rival companies\/families are the capulet's and the montague's. \nthe younger generation of these two families have formed gangs, who despise one another. \nas the storylines goes, romeo montague ( played by leonardo dicaprio ) and juliet capulet ( claire danes ) meet at a fancy dress party, and it is love at first site","krippendorf's tribe is a formula comedy. \ndone poorly, formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema. \nhowever, every now and then, one emerges, like krippendorf's tribe, that actually works. \nprofessor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ), the renowned anthropologist, is in trouble. \nhis university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea","not since 1996's shine, which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott, has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world-class musicians. \nin fact, if one were to watch these films together, it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills. \nyet hilary and jackie, the sophomore effort from director anand tucker, has something more to say -- it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale. \nemily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale, playing the sisters du pr ?. \nboth musicians from childhood, hilary ( griffiths ) is renowned flutist while jacqueline ( watson ) is easily as skilled on the cello. \nthe two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women, both together and seperate. \ntheir careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one another's, and although their lives take very different paths -- hilary settles down to marriage and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour -- they are bound together by their deep family love","luckily, some people got starship troopers. \nsome people knew it was supposed to be silly. \nfor those of you who didn't, how could you miss it ? \nfrom the very beginning, when we see an interactive internet-like promotional video for the armed forces of the future, it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly. \ni guess without blatant one-liners and home alone style slapstick, some people just don't recognize such goofy humor. \nsuch a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned. \nfirst thing to do before seeing this movie - lighten up","the happy bastard's 30-second review \nnotting hill \na cute romantic comedy from the writer of the hit comedy four weddings and a funeral, notting hill stars julia roberts as anna scott, a very popular actress with a $15 million asking price for movies. \none day she wanders into a travel book store owned by a simple london resident ( played by hugh grant ), and sparks somehow begin to fly. \nsure, there are points of turmoil, such as putting up with grant's slightly disgusting ( but very hilarious ) roommate spike, anna's pesky ex-boyfriend ( alec baldwin in a humorous cameo ), and, on top of all that, those damn press. \nit's a fresh sort of complexity to see in a romantic comedy, very different from, say, a stubborn father or \" not the right time \" like as seen in usual flicks. \nroberts is terrific as the astonishingly beautiful actress, and grant is surprisingly good as the straightforward guy still trying to get a hold of what has actually happened with this girl","first, i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series. \ni have nothing against it particularly, i just don't happen to watch it. \nhaving said that, i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well. \nfor us non-fans, there's nothing big going for it, but there are a lot of little things. \nthe movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35, 000 b","many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come, the new film by visionary director vincent ward. \nmost will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors. \nbut little do they know ( as i so plainly found out ) that this has quite a complex story to tell. \nwalking out of the theater, i could see the audience's disgust... \none member even had to be awakened after the film ended","when i was growing up in 1970s, boys in my school used to divide into two groups, based on their action movies preferences. \nthe first one, myself included, liked movies that featured spectacular car chases, lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions. \nthe latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks, probably because they could ( or, to be more precise, thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life. \ndecades later, while refining my own cinematic taste, i began to appreciate and actually like those movies, probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids. \nyes, most of the kung fu and other \" martial arts \" flicks were cheap, they had predictable and formulaic plot, and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills. \nbut, in the same time, those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation","one of the sweetest tales to ever be made, it's a wonderful life isn't perfect, but its good natured charm and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results. \nprobably the greatest \" feel-good \" film of all time, it's a wonderful life aims for the heart, and strikes with a golden arrow. \non christmas eve, george bailey ( stewart ) is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls. \nyou see, george is in trouble, and he has always helped others who needed it. \nthis one time, however, god answers his prayers, and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence ( travers ) to try and save george. \nclarence has got his own problems, however","of circumcision, psychic wounds and the family sitcom \nthe opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film. \nthere's a guy's voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like, and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women. \nas his imagination plays o n, he ( and we ) picture these motley characters in a mix-and-match shuffle of unlikely marriages, businesswomen with bums, matrons with

oscar nominee for best foreign film, directed by tomas gutierrez alea ( who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo-- \" memories of underdevelopment \". \ni saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late '70s ; it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition. \ni knew then that memorias was probably a state-sanctioned political missive, and now expect strawberry will follow suit. \nfellow internetters, primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba ( soc. culture. cuba ), have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs. \ni have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party line--it probably looks like political criticism, but it ain't so. \nhaving some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro's repressiveness, i can't conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution, and i can't imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement","capsule : this is a 1950s or 1960s style heist film, set in the present. \nrobert deniro stars as a risk-adverse safecracker who wants to retire form crime but takes one last job at the request of a personal friend ( played by marlon

amounted to much in life, except working out the finer intricacies of waitering. \ni'm a lucky sort of a guy, especially when a beautiful woman strips away my venner of superficiality to find a new age, sensitive guy with the biggest heart in the entire world underneath - life is beautiful ! \ni'm a jew, but life can still be beautiful. \nthe nazis put me in a concentration camp, but life is

somewhat beautiful ? \ni get shot for my efforts and the woman i love, but hey that's life and that's still a beautiful thing - so by jove don't give me any crap about it ! \nby far the movie with the biggest heart this decade and well deserves every nomination and award that it has achieved","getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity. \nthe film was directed by randal kleiser, who brought us such bubble-gum classics as grease and the blue lagoon. \nbut thanks to kleiser's surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script, getting it right is a pleasantly quiet, moving, and memorable film--one geared strictly toward a sophisticated, adult audience. \ngetting it right stars jesse birdsall ( emily lloyd's boyfriend in wish you were here ) as gavin, a painfully shy 31-year-old hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and who--gasp--is still a virgin. \ngavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon, but expose him to a single 30-year-old beauty and he's a mess. \nmuch to gavin's surprise, the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan ( lynn redgrave ), a rich, married, and lonely 45-year-old. \ngetting it right is the simple story of gavin's awkward and haphazard

story from up-and-coming director bryan singer. \nit's one of those movies that, after everything is revealed rapid-fire at the end, you immediately want to rewind and watch again because earlier scenes take on a new light. \nplot twists a-go-go are what you get here -- i gave up trying to figure out the mystery of keyser soze after awhile and just sat back and waited for them to reveal it to me. \nkeyser soze is a name you'll hear at least a hundred times if you watch the usual suspects and for good reason. \nit's not only the name of the mysterious ( and possibly even mythical ) crime boss in the movie, it also sums up the movie -- \" keyser soze \" in latin means \" an intelligent crime mystery story from up-and-coming director bryan singer","\" dangerous beauty \" is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583. \nit is beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, and certainly nothing short of entertaining, but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness. \ndealing with themes of forbidden love, religious intolerance, subordination of women, sexual freedom, and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high-cultured society, it still feels like brightly lit fluff. \nthe director, marshall herskovitz, doesn't want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down, so he opts for a more genial, livelier, and relatively shallow interpretation. \nthe film takes place during the renaissance, a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe","imagine this scenario : you and any of your family members are scudding through one of those long, excruciating cross-country car trips, far from the city and into the deserted rural routes. \nso far, the trip is idyllic when, abruptly, your car malfunctions and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere. \nit is not an easy situation, but a perfectly plausible one, the panorama in which breakdown musters it's throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness. \nit is not easy to cobble a distinct and gripping thriller nowadays, but breakdown doesn't bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it derives a masterful, titillating climax that by it's finale,

independent films. \nmade on a shoestring budget of $1. 2 million, with then relatively unknown actors, it is a provocative, thoroughly original drama. \nthe film mostly focuses on the four central characters, all in their late 20's-early 30's. \nann ( andie macdowell ), an unfulfilled housewife, is married to john ( peter gallagher ), an insensitive lawyer, who, unbeknownst to her, is having an affair with her younger sister, cynthia ( laura san giacomo ). \ncomplicating matters even worse is graham ( james spader, who won best actor at cannes ), john's old college buddy, who comes to stay at their house. \nann is absolutely won over by him, even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex. \nthat is the set-up for the last hour of the picture, and since the film is entitled, \" sex, lies, and videotape, \" it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise","synopsis : private detective tom welles is hired by a wealthy widow to uncover the origins of a snuff film owned by her late husband. \nafter uncovering the authenticity of the film, welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers. \ncomments : 8 mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time. \nthough it doesn't present a snuff film ( a movie which documents a person's murder for real, usually during or after some form of sexual act ) as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as, say, natural born killers, 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it. \nit is not fun to watch ; see something else if you get upset by realistic, sadistic violence","to me, nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film. \ndespite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed, the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence. \never since the big success of the action-thriller `face\/off' in 1997, the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr. cage. \nthe perpetually awful assassination thriller `snake eyes' was one of 1998's worst films. \n`8mm' was a disappointing lost cause. \nbut who better than scorsese to match cage's wit and intensity, which he does in miraculous fashion with `bringing out the dead'","at first glance, daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie. \non second glance it looks that way too. \nalthough, as typical disaster movies go, daylight isn't that bad. \nadmittedly, it seems to rip off a great deal of its plot devices from disaster flicks of days gone by ( think poseidon adventure ). \nbut the decent dialogue and surprisingly good acting make up for the \" haven't i seen this scene somewhere before ? \" \nfeeling that creeps up all too often during the film. \nsylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new york's emergency response team. \nby sheer luck, he is in the right place at the

epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry, boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking. \nthe film follows a soft-spoken young man, eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance, through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom, and later, to a harrowingly precipitous drop. \nas boogie nights opens, he's toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley

pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules. \non the other hand, the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs, several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast. \nbut mulan is a step in the right direction and disney's best animated feature since the lion king. \nafter giving native americans a turn in pocahontas, disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians. \nmulan is set in feudal china and features the ever-popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her

champion jimmy king ( oliver platt ). \nwhen king is screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter ( joe pantoliano ), gordie and sean take it upon themselves to find their fallen hero and restore his glory. \nmy biggest fear about ready to rumble was dispatched early on, as the filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed ( but not fake, mind you ). \nthe hook of the movie is that gordie and sean are just too stupid to realize that. \narquette and caan are suitably over the top with their performances, which is exactly what a movie like this requires, and oliver platt ( one of my favorite actors ) is a riot as the drunken washed-up ex-champion. \nmany have scoffed at the idea that platt should be playing a heavyweight champion wrestler with an unbeaten record, but for me it just added to the \" silly factor \" of the film, thereby increasing my enjoyment of it. \none casting complaint however : rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer ? \nplease","steven

joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the \" film noir \" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo, miller's crossing, blood simple ), and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric, scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona, the hudsucker proxy ). \ntheir latest offering, the big lebowski, falls within the latter category, though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film. \nthe main difference, however, is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn't quite have the brains to get it all together, the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who's wise to the world, but he doesn't really want to do much of anything besides go bowling, smoke pot, and generally relax. \nthat main character is jeffrey \" the dude \" lebowski ( jeff bridges ), introduced by the film's rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as \" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county. \" \nthe dude is unemployed, needless to say, and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends, walter ( john goodman ), a borderline-psychotic who's in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody's cheating in a bowling match ( \" has the whole world gone crazy ? ! \" he shouts at a suspected cheater ), and donny ( steve buscemi ), who's always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( \" donny, you have no frame of reference here ! \" ). \nthese three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments, and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ), who, when we first meet him, is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of \" hotel california \" and, if it's possible, seems to be even more of a head case than walter. \nif that doesn't give you a good idea of this film's absurdist tone, then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in

emotionally. \nthe film takes place during a few weeks of august at the normandy coast, and centers on six different characters, primarily pauline ( amanda langlet ), a wise beyond her years

). \nwhile pauline watches as an outsider at what is happening between all of the adults, she forms a relationship of her own with a young teenage boy ( simon de la brosse ). \n \" pauline at the beach, \" is not a film in which big dramatic things occur, and there is not a clear-cut, tidy conclusion to the story. \ninstead, it is a picture that simply observes its characters in every day life, and the surprises come from little character details. the film is quite talky and slow moving, and so it is pretty safe to say it isn't for those who are only a fan of action movies, but is a

scripts, cheesy plot twists, and, terrible acting. \nthe fifth element, the abyss, and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting, writing, or both. \nat first glance, the matrix, larry & andy wachowski's sci-fi\/kung-fu\/shoot-em-up spectacular, looks like a prime candidate to join the list of high-concept bad movies, especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role. \nbut despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue, the matrix works. \nit's an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films ( most obviously the terminator films, star wars, and total recall ), but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout. \nreeves plays neo, a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with \" trinity \" ( carrie-anne moss ), a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks, a unseen, omniscient cult figure known as \" morpheus \" ( lawrence fishburne ), and a trio of

tones surrounded by a vast array of blues. \nalluring, attractive blues, but also icy and foreboding. \nafter taking in their beauty, the eye seeks out the reassuring browns and greens, like a tired swimmer searching for the safety of land. \nthe production works that way as well ? it pulls you in initially as a crisp, thoroughly-modern thriller, with clipped exchanges between defiantly non-communicative characters. \nbut the real draw of the film is the submerged humanity of two key players as \" the deep end \" gradually reveals the melodramatic core beneath its ironic candy

comedy that keeps us entertained until the end credits which themselves are funny too. \nit has all it needs to be a breezy entertaining comedy : the acting is up to pace and some of the performances quite funny, the screenplay is witty and smart, and the whole story is sweet and cute. \ndeuce bigalow ( rob schneider ) is your typically average guy : he cleans fish tanks for a living and gets an average of 10 bucks for it","underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today. \n1998's 'hope floats' was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year. \nwe always

audiences are disappointed with it and think it was a disappointment","as fairy tales go, cinderella has to be one of the most famous. \nalmost everyone knows it, well at least in north america. \nso it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it. \nit has been done before with varying results. \nthis version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same

remotely of that nature","it stands as a moment one will not soon forget : a giant, green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale, narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds. \nthis leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek, dreamworks' second computer animated feature, but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema, a page of this tale serves as that ogre's toilet paper. \nfrom this opening moment, one can infer shrek's defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard, disney-esque fairy tale. \nalthough rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek, the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship, courage, and acceptance, excelled by outstanding direction, stunning actor voice work, and most importantly, a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye. \nwhile shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults, positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline : shrek, the previously mentioned ogre, holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community","for a movie about disco-era excess, \" 54 \" comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s and early 1980s manhattan dance club. \nthink of it as a sort of \" boogie nights \" -lite - where that similarly-structured and -set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings-on and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift, \" 54 \" leaves the kinkier details to your imagination. \nit never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter, but it thankfully never resorts to preaching, either. \nin fact, were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment, \" 54 \" would be about as feathery as the time period's popular female hairstyle. \nstudio 54 was a haven for the rich, famous and generally good-looking before it closed its doors forever in 1986. \ninside, anything went and, we are told, everything did. \nthe film's fictional main character is shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe, the jerky jock from \" i know what you did last summer \" ), a fresh-faced 19-year-old who dreams of venturing beyond the club's velvet rope and coming face-to-face with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines","in 1994, an insider's look at a scandal-ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination ( closely based on clinton's 1992 campaign ) was written anonymously ( former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship ). \nnow, the book, primary colors, has been made into a movie, directed by mike nichols, and, in light of recent presidential scandals, seems to be more relevant than ever. \nbut the film is more than a diatribe against, or a paean in praise of, the president. \nit is a fascinating look at the political machinery, and the ethical quagmire, that surround modern politics. \njack stanton ( john travolta ) is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination. \nhe is charismatic, but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign, and strains his relationship with his wife, susan ( emma thompson ). \nthe film is told from the point of view of henry burton ( adrian lester ), grandson of a civil rights leader, who is swept away by stanton's ideals and helps to organize the campaign. \nhe joins

many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick's final film, but it is an impressive achievement ; a mesmerizing, haunting, adult psychodrama about marriage, fidelity and sex. \nit's a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end, consistently exhibiting the auteur's trademark penchant for long, continuous takes, his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast ( indeed, eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot : kubrick, a renowned perfectionist, reportedly held his cast \" hostage \" on the set for nearly a year ). \nin an uncharacteristic maneuver, kubrick cast two big-name stars in the lead roles, namely real-life husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman.

states in the late 1970s and early 1980s. \nthe film unweaves its tale in a chronological order : we open with young and dirt-poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy, peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky","until i saw the night of the hunter, it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie. \nforget the others and the deep end ( which veered toward strained dramatics ), the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie i've seen so far this year. \neven though the movie is nearly 50 years old and there's a not drop of blood to be seen. \nluckily, the night of the hunter, charles laughton's first and final directing gig, has been restored by the ucla film and television archive and is being re-released in october

lacks humidity. \nand as tourism is unfortunately jamaica's biggest trade, foreigners enter and leave with a sense of relaxation. \nlife and debt takes a brassy look at life inside this impoverished country. \nwhile normal documentaries take the sally struthers approach of underlying scenes of starving children with tearful music, this film guides the viewer with a sarcastic voiceover that brings the troubles home without begging tears to the surface. \nthe voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid. \nit guides the audience along a tourist's journey and the story of the native inhabitants","denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances. \nthis perhaps may be washington's very best to date. \nhe joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent, this season, to become his character, copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly. \nhis very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting \" the hurricane \" a much better film than it actually is. \nwhen his rubin \" hurricane \" carter feels pain and is tormented by racism, he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy, disgust, and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices. \nthe horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago. \nthe powerful expressions of denzel washington alone, as his tortured carter, sum up the troubles of racism in america's history","[note : after claiming otherwise, my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branagh's hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap. \nas it happens, it didn't take long. ] \nis there a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli ? \nknown mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968's romeo and juliet ( required viewing for many high schoolers, and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare ), he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera, where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria. \nlast year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre, one of the twin peaks ( with wuthering heights ) of romantic literature. \nit might seem peculiar, then, that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen. \nat first blush, hamlet is far removed from romance. \nthe hero, though a prince, is depressed, conflicted and confused. \nthe ostensible love interest gets little screen time, and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery","the happy bastard's quick movie review \nme tarzan... you

on his own terms. \nhe made the west dirty in \" mccabe and mrs. miller \" ( 1971 ), he parodied hard-boiled detective stories in \" the long goodbye \" ( 1973 ), and he transformed a cartoon into

\ncarlito's way, while hampered by depalma's characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism, is a truly tense and engrossing drama. \ncarlito brigante ( pacino ) is a life-long criminal who finds

will strike some as a brute of a film. \nit not only demands your attention, but challenges you to grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions. \nit is delirious, depressing, heady, pretentious, surreal filmmaking. \nit's also a movie that will polarize its viewers. \ndirector paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast, wraps them in a net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair whose song doesn't let up until an oddly exhilerating, biblically influenced pseudo-climax. \nthe character's make up a modern day gomorrah in

in an attempt to to prevent a scene, his mother in law, played by irma p. hall, comes to the rescue. \nthe way in which she does this makes me think irma p. hall is one of the greatest actresses around right now","director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one ). \nfilm is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story, but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something. \nbut most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story. \nso whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential, the film almost automatically deserves a good review. \nand when they add a fascinating story to it, you have nearly perfect entertainment. \nfincher's the game is no exception to this. \nthe game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time. \nfincher hasn't made a film since \"

of her first feature film roles. \nplot : high-school musical set in the 1950's showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the t-birds ( travolta ) and the innocent and pure sandy olsen ( newton-john ) from australia. \nthe film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song, dance and humour. \ncritique : fun-loving, energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler. \nthis movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950's, with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers","set in the late 80's at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie, less than zero ), american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie \" genre \" that ellis helped to create. \nchristian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman, a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues. \nit seems that bateman is a serial killer and, unfortunately for his contemporaries, his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip. \nas he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies, his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel. \ni was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school. \ni read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it. \nas usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out, but i soon forgot about the novel and didn't end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a

rodman was actually from this planet ? \nor if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extra-terrestrial ? \ni used to think that about my 7th grade english teacher, ms. carey. \nbut after seeing this movie, they may have confirmed my suspicions. \nas the story goes, at any time, there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth. \nthe men in black ( mib ) are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens, guardians of our beloved planet from nasty-tempered aliens, and secret service to the stars. \nbased in new york city ( where weird is the norm ), the mib organization gives human form to our space-faring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed. \nbut to enforce the laws of earth, the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast. \nthey carry other-worldly technology to erase people's short-term memory when common folk see the mib in action","i feel no hesitation in saying that \" there's something about mary \" is the best film that i will see all year. \nfrom the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture, there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998. \nit is that good of a film. \nwhen gene siskel said this about \" fargo \" only a few months into '96, i dismissed the notion as ridiculous. \nhow could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it ? \nbut after seeing the farrelly's hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork, i now know what siskel was talking about","\" i'd rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell, \" earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher. \nwith that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister, hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story. \nhe will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american, and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation. \nfrom elmer gantry on, we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church. \nwell, think again, for the apostle, which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade, does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister, and by implication all, the rest of organized religion. \ninstead it gives us a highly devout man, who certainly has his foibles, but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god. \nand arguably just as surprising, the good-spirited film is no comedy, even if it does have humorous moments. \ninstead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures","one of the best movies i've ever seen. \ni'd heard extremely good things about this movie, and though the previews didn't really intrigue that much, it was a movie i'd been anticipating for a few months now. \nfor some reason i'm not sure of - this movie was not that big a sucess over in the u. s. it was a definite hit with the critics, but didn't exactly set any box office records. \nafter viewing this incredibly well directed, written and acted movie, i can't help but wonder - why ? \nthe strength of this film is it's gritty realism. \nthe main characters are all human with individual flaws, no stereo-type hollywood heroes","this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in 1989. \nwhether it was the meddling of studio executives, or the work of writer\/director james cameron himself, the original cut of this underwater sci-fi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed. \nthe main problem was fairly simple : the film's climax was unworthy of its build-up. \nsomeone at 20th century fox - and no doubt cameron himself - must have agreed, because in 1993 came the theatrical release of the abyss : special edition. \nnow available on video, it seems timely to re-evaluate what, in its newly revamped state, is now a near-masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010 : odyssey two, alien and close encounters of third kind","i have a soft spot in my heart for pure, amoral sleaze. \ni liked showgirls ( there, i said it ). \ni typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz, sex-filled cinematic tabloid-ish trash. \nwild things is the best sleazy film i've ever seen. \nit's filled with great performances, graphic sex, three-way sex, rape charges, double-crosses, plot twists, genitalia of all genders, graphic violence, death, witty humor, and, best of all, denise richards. \ncriticizing this film for being disgusting, raucous, and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing, or titanic for being lofty and epic. \nwild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors, but i don't just admire it for this--i admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies. \ni must admit up-front, however, that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal","tarzan chad'z = good ) 1999, g, 90 minutes [1 hour, 30 minutes] [animated - adventure\/drama] starring the voices of : tony goldwyn ( tarzan ), minnie driver

animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly for children but with enough wit and charm for adults to be interested and at least entertained by the story. \nthe basic premise is the same as every other `tarzan' story : a boy is raised in the african jungle by gorillas and becomes one himself never really understanding ( or even noticing ) that he's human and is a lot different from the animals he befriends. \nthe first third of the film shows how tarzan comes to be adopted by kala ( voiced by glen close ), a female gorilla who lost her own child in a classic case of darwanism","i've always been told that there are two things in life that are unavoidable - death and taxes. \noddly, i've never given much thought to either of the two. \nmaybe if i did, at least i'd stop getting collection notices from uncle sam. \nyes, let me make a resolution to devote myself to better record keeping, hold on to all my receipts, and to do what it takes to have the satisfaction that my returns are mistake-free and will keep me from incurring penalties. \nit seems that the issue of death may not be so different, at least envisioned here in this film","it was a crazy time in france, what with the french revolution right around the corner. \nking louis xv would soon die, and his son would become king louis xvi. \nsuch is the setting for beaumarchais : the scoundrel about the controversial playwright, spy and playboy pierre-augustin caron de beaumarchais. \nbeaumarchais was the author of the plays, \" the barber of seville \" and \" the marriage of figaro. \" \ntoday people think of them as quaint and harmless operas, but, back in 1773 when the movie takes place, they were so scandalous that beaumarchais was thrown into prison more than once","what surprises me most about the long-awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker. \nthe dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis ! \ni can hear batfans everywhere protesting : \" first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman, and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker ! ! \" \nand, indeed, this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play. \nnicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding, oscar-worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman. \nnicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown ( romero played the joker in the '60s tv series ). \non one hand, nicholson's joker is extremely funny","casting \" doogie howser \" star neil patrick harris as mind-reading military intelligence is only one of the guilty pleasures of \" starship troopers, \" a hugely entertaining, mega-budgeted sci-fi yarn directed by paul verhoeven, who's making quite a recovery from his 1995 g-string epic \" showgirls. \" \nsure, \" starship troopers \" qualifies as cinematic junk food, but that's forgivable when the junk food is this tasty. \neveryone needs a high-calorie change-of-pace from fall's onslaught of costume dramas and other assorted oscar bait, and \" troopers \" does the job admirably despite its flaws. \nfor its first hour, \" starship troopers \" plays like a cheeky futuristic hybrid of \" saved by the bell \" and \" g. i","historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s. \nfor many critics, scholars and, most importantly, film producers, it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black-and-white television and non-cgi special effects. \nbut in 1995, same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago, there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor, producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre. \nand, same as in the case of dances with wolves, he was awarded for his effort with \" oscars \". \nthe name of the film was braveheart, and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson. \nthe plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 )","if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child, would you do it ? \n \" gattaca \" is a film which presents a future where society has answered \" yes \" to this question, but then ponders if this was actually the right decision. \n \" gattaca \" came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature, the lovable dolly the sheep, and with this in mind, the film only becomes more frightening. \nthe way the realm of genetics is heading, it may only take a couple decades until the future \" gattaca \" presents becomes true. \ncontrary to the misleading trailers, \" gattaca \" is not a sci-fi thriller, in the way that there's lots of murder, hitchcockian suspense, and chase scenes. \nthis is a quiet, sad film about intelligent theories. \nin fact, the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley ( the latter who's novel \" brave new world \" featured genetically engineered children ). \nit's a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia, which is exactly what \" gattaca \" presents.","in one scene from \" the people vs. \nlarry flynt, \" the hustler magazine publisher appears at a self-staged free speech rally. \nas graphic photos flash on a huge screen behind him, flynt strides confidently across the stage, delivering a rousing speech over what really constitutes obscenity. \nthe spectacle was reminiscent of the scene in \" patton \" where the general spoke in front of a giant american flag. \nboth scenes were stirring, larger than life, richly entertaining, and felt totally like contrived set pieces for big hollywood movies. \noverall, that sums up \" the people vs. \nlarry flynt","we all know the fate of \" child's play, \" which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially : sequel hell. \nwith the newest installment in the quasi-popular series currently out ( that would be \" bride of chucky \" - and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend, which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five ), it's kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original, a task which is a retread for some, and for others ( namely myself ) a chance to see what all the fuss was about. \nalas, the original \" child's play \" actually isn't that bad. \neven seeing it in the tiny, claustrophobic, and mechanically-challenged theatre at my college wasn't the horribly dull experience i thought it would be, not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd ( which you almost need to watch a film like this - and if you don't believe me, try and watch this flick by yourself one day ), but because as a whole, this isn't a bad movie. \nit's not great, but it does have two things that many horror films like this one don't have : 1 ) a rather nifty premise, and 2 ) a sense of humor, both which save this from horror hell, which is precisely where, say, \" i know what you did last summer \" has recently gone. \nthe premise of \" child's play \" is that a serial killer named charles lee ray ( brad douriff ) is shot and almost killed by a chicago hard-boiled detective ( chris surrandon - see what happens to some oscar nominees ? ), and before he dies, utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kid's doll called chucky, a doll which has got to be the scariest-looking kid's doll i've ever seen. \nthe next day, a bum who's stolen it sells it to single-mother karen barclay ( catherine hicks ), who then gives it to her young son andy ( alex vincent ) for his birthday. \nof course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll, but certain twists come up","director : penelope spheeris ( decline of western civilization ii - the :

fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy's mother, a fledgling restauranteur. \nunsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman's favor, he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in

and direct-to-video. \ntheir proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they're typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects, no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ). \nstalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary, he's rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover, ex-wife, or ex-husband ). \nother than that, stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable. \nstalked does not provide much suspense, though that is what it sets out to do","capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace.

his homage to himself. \n, 0 ( -4 to +4 ). \njohn carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes. \nfor a writer and director

low-powered alien menace","so ask yourself what \" 8mm \" ( \" eight millimeter \" ) is really all about. \nis it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy, sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ? \nis it about the business itself, how, bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana, there's a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won't necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ? \nor is it about those who can, those who are in a position to influence the making of

tired serial killer genre standards. \nthe big letdown, however, comes upon the realization that this 100-minute head-scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan, the man behind \" the crying game. \" \nhe's no stranger to cinematic weirdness, but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope. \nthings start out strong enough, with cinematographer darius khondji's stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat. \nthis eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship

head-chopping, alien-possessed clutches. \nfilled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks, flashes-sideways, and viewpoint changes, ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action sequences","reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others, each derivative in their own special way ). \nthe guy can't seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : \" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel \" ), create multi-faceted characters, or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ). \nhis screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight. \ni can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard, \" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here, f * ck you jack ass, take that twist, decipher this mother f * cker ! \" \nit's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie. \nand why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? \nauteur theory be damned ; it's kruger's \" style \", not the director's that winds up on screen. \nkruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut \" sometimes less is

that when it comes to going to the dogs, more is definitely * not * the merrier. \n1996's \" 101 dalmatians \" certainly wasn't the greatest movie-going experience of all time, but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous, larger-than-life performance. \nin addition, we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson, and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies. \nthis time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen, and close's facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white

with best-selling author hal lindsey, discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent ( well for 1976 anyway ) events. \nthe film is dated badly, as many things that are supposed to happen in the \" future \" never do. \nfor example, the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth. \nwe're still here. \nthe arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick-off the apocalypse","play it to the bone, the newest addition to ron shelton's sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways. \nlike most of shelton's other great films ( bull durham, white men can't jump ), this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots. \nshelton's films are not considered sports films, but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story. \nshelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions. \nplay it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull, but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse","some movies i should just skip. \nmy daughter and i had a really vile time at my

speak for themselves. \nswelling, saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy, and that the situation is hopeless. \nalas, my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up. \nwhat reminded me was that i wasn't choked up, or even the slightest bit moved, for that matter. \nmy giant is a forced, contrived, and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word \" cute \" but i've chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a \" cute \" film here ). \nit takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ), and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches, all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience. \nmaybe it will work for some people","this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and getting away with the cash. \nthis is more about a parable of greed, and how money can become the bane of your life. \nyes, there are elements of ? fargo' here ( the snow and cold ), although not as vivid in the blood and gore department. \nit shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives. \nand how at the end of the day, the things that matter most are love, truth and honesty. \nalthough in one sense it may seem tedious, making a movie about the ugliness of greed ( not box office material ), it does become tedious, not because of the morale ending, but because one expects the movie to end that way. \nthis becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime, the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there","based on the 1960s tv series that i

\nsquandering an intriguing premise, the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess, widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success, raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley's a splendid actor, but a marquee name he ain't ). \nmiraculously dodging the bullet with the first film, i doubted that they'd dare tempt fate and go for another round. \nso here comes species ii, with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman, respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor, species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid. \nthe film follows the exploits of a young man, patrick ross ( justin lazard ), whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women, loitering in strip clubs, and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can","the sequel to the fugitive ( 1993

the magical g into megabucks to get in good with his boss ( robert loggia ). \nit doesn't take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush, with realizations taking place left and right and poor plot

features a string of hapless, c-list actors ( among them bacon, elisabeth shue, josh brolin, and kim dickens ) in a grade-z plot with a lot of special effects that, frankly, don't look much better than those used in the 1933 version of \" the invisible man. \" \noh bacon glistens when he gets wet all right and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap flank steak when he's attempting reentry but otherwise it's lots of \" thermal \" shots and inanimate objects ( elisabeth shue included ) bobbing around without any visible signs of support. \nsince invisibility, once achieved, isn't much of an effect ( the actors spend half their time conversing with nobody and the other half of their time talking to each other--it amounts to much of a muchness ), the director elects to wardrobe all of his

fonda in once upon a time in the west, or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it. \nthey should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast

world, damnation alley, the ultimate warrior, and so on. \nto date, the most smoothly done were straightforward \" haircuts \" of the classic western plot, like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization, usually one in possession of some critical resource, like water, feed range, or a mining claim. \nmost of these grew out of venerable, but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane. \n ( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn, which was fairly well made on a small budget. ) \nnow we have waterworld, which

lo and behold, here comes \" switchback, \" and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as \" kiss the girls \" and \" i know what you did last summer. \" \nbut \" switchback \" is an undoubtedly weak

jerry springer \" show every day. \ni find it quite entertaining, despite its complete lack of redeeming value. \nhaving said that, the show itself is outrageous, funny, and always filled with goofy surprises, as opposed to this film which features no laughs ( is this a comedy or a drama ? ), uninteresting and completely unbelievable one-dimensional stereotypes, and a contrived plot which bores us stupid all the way. \ni never thought i would utter the word boring in the same sentence as jerry springer, but this film is an absolute yawn-fest, despite offering various scenes featuring

strain real hard, i could even say that it's an obvious given, particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr. cameron's early works. \nin fact, \" virus \" is yet another in the long line of action\/horror\/paranoia thrillers from the \" aliens \" vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them, a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies, and maybe even to the first pictures, albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future. \nno such thing will happen to bruno, whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron's wing for years and years, i'm beginning to wonder at what capacity, and what exactly did he learn from him. \nin fact, \" virus \" should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who, if anything, just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like \" virus \" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film, albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget. \nthe film seems to not only borrow it's plot from last year's similarly-fated \" deep rising, \" but also from a clunkish b-movie from the '80s called \" leviathan, \" an underwater thriller starring peter weller, richard crenna, hector elizando, and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part \" alien, \" part

stealing enough money for a healthy retirement. \nhe _should_ have played the town sheriff, an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman. \nas a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg, its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases. \ni say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town

that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget. \nthis is the only way i can fathom how

than the one used in the embarrassing production. \nof course, no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city, since the film's troubles originated with the
