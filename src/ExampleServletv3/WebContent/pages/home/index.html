					the fall when Butler was accom ponied by eighty men commanded by Colonel Harney. Again the
					Indians were elusive and non-committal. The next summer in 1844, another effort was made when
					Captain Nathan Boone, with a company of the First Dragoons, left the past September 25 and went
					to the rendezvous in Texas; but the Indians had left when Boone arrived and he returned to Fort
					Gibson unsuccessful, after an absence of six weeks. A fourth attempt was made when in January,
					1846, Governor Butler departed from Fort Gibson with a large company of civilian hunters and
					adventurers and representatives of the Creek, Cherokee, Chickasaw, and Seminole tribes. Butler
					was finally successful, and on May 15, 1846, at Council Springs, Texas, negotiated a treaty of

			<div class="col-sm-8 form-group">
				<P>Altars of Sacrifice was the third novel of Augusta Jane Evans, one of the leading women
					writers of nineteenth-century domestic fiction. A wartime best seller, with more than twenty
					thousand copies in circulation in the print-starved Confederacy before the war's end, the novel
					was also extremely well received along the Union front, so much so that some northern officials
					thought it should be banned. Long out of print and largely unavailable until now, Macaria is a
					compelling narrative about women and war. In Macaria, Evans charts the journey of two southern
					women toward ultimate self-realization through their service in the war-torn Confederacy. Irene
					and Electra struggle to assert their independence and gain for themselves a place in southern
					society apart from their now-disrupted domestic roles. Discarding the traditional theme of
					romantic fulfillment, Evans skillfully crafts a novel about women compelled by the departure
					and death of so many southern men to find meaning in their own "single blessedness, " rather
					than in marriage. Thus Evans successfully subverts the characteristic form of women's fiction,
					that of the romance narrative, to create a "quest" narrative, more common in men's fiction.
					Macaria appealed directly and calculatedly to sentiments prevailing within its potential
					audience of southern women readers - acknowledging their fears of uselessness and of widowhood
					or spinsterhood, as well as their attraction to a new language of self-determination. In her
					perceptive introduction to this edition, Drew Gilpin Faust places the novel in the context of
					the concerns of Confederate nationalism and the contributions of women during the CivilWar. She
					shows that Evans, though a staunch supporter of the Confederacy and a wartime hospital
					volunteer, felt marginal to the war effort and, like many other women, bemoaned this fact in
					diaries and letters. It is from this aspect, the emergence of the literary woman, that Faust</P>
