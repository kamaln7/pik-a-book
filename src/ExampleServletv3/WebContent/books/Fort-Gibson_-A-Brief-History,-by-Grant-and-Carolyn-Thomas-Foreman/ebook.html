<p class="tb">Fort Gibson was not only the oldest and most celebrated
military establishment in the annals of Oklahoma
but in its early days it was the farthest west outpost of
the United States, and in many respects continued for years
to be one of the most important on that frontier. It was one
of the chain of forts reaching from the northern to the southern
boundaries of the nation, which included Fort Snelling,
Fort Leavenworth, Fort Gibson, Fort Towson, and Fort Jesup,
at times there were as many soldiers stationed at Fort Gibson
as in all the other forts together. It was constructed in a wilderness
frequented by bears, wolves, and panthers, while the
neighboring prairies were the feeding grounds of wild horses,
buffalo and deer. The nearby streams were rich in beaver,
and furs were shipped by trappers and traders to eastern
markets.</p>
<p>This fort actually owed its establishment to the indomitable
spirit of the Osage Indians who ranged the surrounding
country and claimed exclusive right to the game in that locality;
consequently they challenged the hunters from eastern
Indian tribes, notably the Cherokees, and were constantly
engaging in savage battles with them. This situation resulted
in the establishment, in 1817, of a garrison at Belle
Point, subsequently called Fort Smith, which it was hoped
would be able to abate the warlike activities of the Osages.
As it was not able to achieve the desired results, the garrison
was abandoned and the troops were directed to find a new
location at the mouth of the Verdigris River, where they
would be near the towns of the Osages and better able to
watch and control their movements.</p>
<p>When Colonel Matthew Arbuckle came up the Arkansas
River with his command of the Seventh Infantry, he
found the best boat landing on the Verdigris River, and adjacent
territory for three miles above its mouth, occupied by
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
a considerable settlement of white traders and trappers, the
earliest trading settlement within the limits of Oklahoma.
Most conspicuous among the settlers was Colonel A. P. Chouteau,
a graduate of West Point of the class of 1806, who
resigned from the army the next year to engage in Indian
trade. From 1815 to the time of his death in 1838 he was
identified with the Indian Territory and performed valuable
service for the government in the negotiation of important
treaties with the Indians, with whom he had more influence
than any other man of his time. He was long a familiar and
welcome figure at Fort Gibson. His judgment commanded
greater respect of army officers, commissioners and Washington
officials than that of any other man on the frontier;
he was frequently consulted and his services solicited for the
settlement of important problems relating to the Indians.</p>
<p>In connection with his Indian trade at the Three Forks,
Chouteau’s establishment was integrated with the facilities
of river navigation. He employed a large number of men for
assorting and packing for shipment the peltries purchased
from the Indians; he also maintained a little shipyard on the
bank of the river where he made the boats in which, with
the help of a rough and hardy class of river men, he shipped
his peltries to New Orleans and St. Louis. As the settlement
of traders and trappers would have made it troublesome to
establish a garrison on the site, Arbuckle decided to find a
location for his fort a short distance up the nearby Grand
River, which discharged its waters into the Arkansas about
half a mile from the mouth of the Verdigris.</p>
<p>It was on the twenty-first day of April 1824, that two
long flatboats were to be seen ascending Grand River, manned
by bearded young men in the uniform of the United
States Army. As they worked the boats up the river they scanned
the shore for a landing place, and about three miles from
the river’s mouth they were successful in discovering a wide
ledge of shelving rock on the east bank, which made a natural
boat landing. They tied up their boats at this ledge, and
unloaded axes, adzes, froes, saws, food supplies, tents, baggage,
and a miscellaneous assortment of camp equipment.
On the bank they met other uniformed young men, unshaved
and long of hair, who had come by land to the place from
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
Fort Smith with their horses and oxen. They were, in all, 122
officers and privates of companies B, C, G, and K of the Seventh
Infantry.</p>
<p>The river bottom land near their landing place was low
and fertile, and covered by an immense canebrake, great
forest trees, and a jungle of vines and undergrowth. The
soldiers were soon engaged in clearing sufficient space in
which to set up their tents. Then began the weeks and
months of labor necessary to remove the cane, vines, and
brambles from an area large enough for an army post; the
ring of the ax and the crash of the huge falling trees were
heard, and roaring fires consumed the prodigality of nature.
Logs were fashioned by axes and cross-cut saws into lengths
and shapes suitable to form the walls of houses; other logs
were split into puncheons for floors, or rived into clapboards
to roof the structures to be built.</p>
<p>By the early part of 1826 a number of log houses had
been completed, providing quarters for the soldiers, quartermaster,
sergeants, surgeon, and a hospital, guard room, matron’s
room and storeroom. These buildings were constructed
on four sides of a square and, with the upright logs or pickets
surrounding them, constituted the stockade, so arranged for
protection against possible attack by the Indians. This stockade
has long since fallen into decay; but on the site another
has been constructed from the original plans, as nearly like
the old one as possible, where it is now to be seen.</p>
<p>Fort Gibson maintained communication with the outside
world by means of transportation on the Arkansas River over
which, at first, the keelboat brought men and supplies to the
fort from remote distances, and down which furs and peltries
were shipped by the traders living in the neighborhood. Later,
steamboats that supplanted the keelboats came up to the
fort with military supplies and merchandise for the sutler at
the post and for merchants in that vicinity. During 1833,
seventeen steamboats were tied up to the boat landing from
time to time through the season. Under the railroad bridge
which now spans the river at this spot may be seen one of
the rings anchored in the rock to which the boats were secured
many years ago. The fort was also reached by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
famous thoroughfare known as the Texas Road, which came
through southwestern Missouri, southeastern Kansas, and
following the course of Grand River passed Fort Gibson and
continued on to Texas. For many years an amazing number
of emigrants, freighters, and traders going to or returning
from the then unknown country beyond Red River passed
over this road.</p>
<p>In 1831, the whole of the Seventh Infantry was ordered
to Fort Gibson and the officers reported the interior of the
stockade much overcrowded by the host of officers and men,
laundresses and servants. The year 1832 was a notable one
in the history of Fort Gibson. A commission had been created
by Congress for the purpose of locating in the Indian Territory
the Indians about to be removed from the East. It was
necessary for the commission to make its headquarters at
Fort Gibson, and negotiate treaties with the wild Indians
which were to prepare them for the impending changes in
their neighbors. The commissioners were Montford Stokes,
until then governor of North Carolina, Henry L. Ellsworth,
of Hartford, Connecticut, and Rev. John Schermerhorn. They
were afforded protection by the Ranger company of Captain
Jesse Bean, who arrived at the post in October, 1832,
and was then ordered to the West on an exploring tour. Mr.
Ellsworth arrived at Fort Gibson that same month, accompanied
by Washington Irving and some friends whom he had
met on Lake Erie and had invited to accompany him to Fort
Gibson. They came down the Texas Road past the Creek
agency at Three Forks, just below the site of Okay, and arrived
at the bank of Grand River, across which Irving noted
the neatly whitewashed blockhouses and palisades of Fort
Gibson. Someone halooed across the river, and a scow, which
served as ferryboat, was brought over; the travelers entered
the boat, which was poled by soldiers across the stream; as
it was tied up to the landing the visitors stepped ashore and
walked up the bank 150 yards to the gate of the garrison. A
sergeant’s guard admitted them, and as they entered the fort
their attention was attracted to a number of men pilloried in
stocks and riding the wooden horse. Startled at this spectacle,
Irving made a note of it in his journal.</p>
<p>On their arrival at Fort Gibson, Washington Irving and
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
Commissioner Ellsworth and their friends, on learning that
Captain Bean’s company was somewhere up the Arkansas
River, after spending two nights in Colonel Arbuckle’s quarters
in the fort, started out to overtake the Rangers and
share in their adventures. They were gone a month on this
trip, and from his experiences on that expedition Irving wrote
his famous book, <b>A Tour on the Prairies</b>. The company returned
to Fort Gibson on the ninth of November, and the
next day Irving departed down the Arkansas River by steamboat
for New Orleans and Washington.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the fort were awakened each morning
as the bugler sounded reveille at daybreak to rouse a
sleeping garrison; later the crash of the morning gun echoed
and re-echoed among the neighboring hills and rumbled
across the more distant prairies, startling deer and bear in
their sheltered beds. The flag was run to the top of the staff
to catch the first rays of the rising sun. After an early breakfast
the soldiers went about their routine duties; details worked
in the garrison garden among the vegetables; oxen, horses,
and mules were fed, watered, and cared for; recruits were
put through their drills by the sharp commands of officers,
and the bugle sounded at intervals throughout the day, carrying
its lively messages over the surrounding valleys and hills.</p>
<p>The end of the day of toil or boredom, as the case might
be, was announced by the drums sounding retreat, followed
by the evening gun and the ceremony of lowering the flag at
sunset. The roll of the drum and the shrill notes of the fife
sounded tatoo at nine o’clock and warned stragglers to cease
their amours and other diversions and return to their quarters
within the palisades before the great gates should close
and shut them out; taps then sounded, and Fort Gibson was
again stilled in darkness. This routine repeated day after day,
month after month, and year after year, made life at the
post a dull experience. It was an isolated station in the western
wilderness, far from civilization and white settlements of
consequence. The officers and men, exiled, as they termed
it, to this remote garrison, wearied of its limited possibilities
for entertainment. Trifling incidents varied the dull routine
of their lives, and episodes that mattered were of absorbing
interest.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Some cheerful diversions were available, however; there
was good fishing in the river a few yards from the post, and
thousands of prairie chickens and other game afforded zestful
hunting. A billiard room furnished entertainment. Plays
were written and presented in the “theater,” the building
used on occasions for Indian councils and religious services.</p>
<p>A course was laid out and every year there were exciting
horse races for high stakes with entries from all divisions of
the fort’s population—officers, traders, and Indians. Indian
ponies, that hardly had time to rest up from running buffalo,
were entered against the horses of the post. And there were
crooked race horse owners who came up the river to the fort
for the sole purpose of making what money they could by
their peculiar methods. This situation became so demoralizing
that Colonel Loomis issued an order barring these people
from the reservation. When other things palled—and when
they did not—there was always the gossip of the post, rumors
and confirmation of promotions, expeditions, and details; the
departure of a command on a commission that would at least
give the men a change of scene; the rare arrival of the paymaster,
with fifty to one hundred thousand dollars in the
custody of his military escort; the frequent arrival of steamboats
when the rivers were high; and when they were not,
visitors and supplies coming by keelboats, wagons, or pack
trains.</p>
<p>The hoarse resonance of a steam whistle in the distance
told a jaded garrison that a steamboat on the Arkansas River
was approaching the fort. Presently the boom of the signal
gun on board announced that she had passed the bars three
miles below and had safely entered the Grand River. There
was always a crowd at the landing place to see her as she
came into view down the stream. As the jangle of her bell
or the exhaust of her engines heralded her arrival, the multitude
was increased by people who were anxious to share in
the excitement when she was tied up to the shelving rock
that made a natural dock.</p>
<p>For there were passengers to come ashore—friends to
greet, who were returning from leave with news from the outside
world, messages, and newspapers, and strangers to inspect—young
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
officers from West Point, older officers trained
by service in other posts who had come to a new assignment,
recruits to fill gaps in the ranks. There were civilians,
too, merchants from the neighborhood who had been east
exchanging furs and skins for fresh supplies of merchandise;
sutlers who brought stores to sell to the officers and
soldiers, and bonnets, dresses, and finery for the ladies of
the post. And there were wives and children come to unite
long-separated families, and young ladies who planned to visit
and bring a measure of gaiety to the garrison. Mail bags
promised letters from distant relatives and friends. Deck
hands and soldiers unloaded boxes and crates of merchandise.
It was a busy and noisy scene. Officers went aboard to
enjoy the hospitality of the captain and to sample the liquors
on his boat.</p>
<p>Young ladies came from the East to visit relatives at
the post and they frequently married officers whom they met
there, or had previously known. In the 1830’s and 1840’s,
when Fort Gibson received many young officers recently out
of West Point, such romances were common.</p>
<p>Propinquity and the charm of the Cherokee maidens accounted
for many unions between them and the soldiers and
officers at the post. Fort Gibson was the center of society
and gaiety for a large section of the country that included
the Cherokee Nation. The young women of that tribe were
much sought by the officers and were welcome guests at the
parties given at the post, where many romances budded and
bloomed during the seventy years the old fort existed. The
result was that in that part of Oklahoma which formerly
constituted the Cherokee Nation, many families descended
from unions between the soldiers and Indians. Frequently,
when their terms of enlistment expired, soldiers remained in
the neighborhood, married Indian girls, reared Indian families,
and become prosperous from the land holdings these
alliances brought them.</p>
<p>For want of diversions of greater interest, numbers of
soldiers at Fort Gibson sought such excitement as they could
find in the doggeries maintained by mixed-blood Cherokee
Indians on tribal lands just off the reservation, where drinking
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
and gambling were indulged in. Violations of the rule
forbidding a soldier to remain outside the garrison after retreat
had sounded were frequent, and iron bars were employed
on the windows in the outer walls of the houses to enforce
the regulations. These precautionary measures, said an
observer, gave the barracks the appearance of a dilapidated
Arkansas jail: the enclosure, he said, was made to hold five
companies of troops—officers and men, laundresses and
servants herded together in a climate where the temperature
ranged in summer from eighty to one hundred degrees.
These remarks truly painted a picture that explained much
of the resistance to discipline and violation of regulations.</p>
<p>As an instance of punishment, an offender was sentenced
to “stand on the head of a barrel with an empty bottle in
each hand, in front of the dragoon guardhouse every alternate
two hours from reveille until retreat for eight days with
a board around his neck marked ‘Whiskey Seller,’ to carry a
pack on his back weighing fifty pounds every alternate two
hours for eight days, from reveille until retreat; to work at
hard labor in charge of the guard for fourteen days, and to
have seven days of his pay stopped.” Another culprit was
sentenced “to be drummed around the garrison immediately
in the rear of Corporal Charles Kelloun of H Company, First
Dragoons, carrying a keg in his arms, to have a plank hanging
on his back marked ‘Whiskey Runner,’ and to serve fifteen
days at hard labor in charge of the guard, making good
all time lost by sickness.”</p>
<p>Drunkenness and desertion were the most persistent
and difficult violations with which officers had to deal. The
courts martial varied the punishments inflicted upon offenders
as far as their imagination would permit. One culprit
was sentenced to the custody of the guard for thirty days
“and during that period to walk in front of the guardhouse
with a pack of stones weighing fifty pounds upon his back
from eight o’clock A. M. to one P. M., and from two o’clock
P. M. to retreat.” Another, in the winter was condemned “to
be immersed for ten consecutive mornings in the river, fifteen
minutes before breakfast roll call.” Another’s sentence
was to have his “hands tied to a post above his head from
reveille to guard mount, five days at hard labor, and to forfeit
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
one dollar per day and his portion of sugar and coffee.”
Forfeiture of sugar, coffee, and whiskey was a cruel measure
often resorted to. Sentence to the stocks was employed, and
frequently the garrison displayed the ghastly spectacle of a
dozen men with hands and heads projected through these
cruel devices which compelled them to stand and gave them
no support. It was charged that in some cases culprits had
died under this punishment. In October 1833, two privates of
the First Dragoons convicted of desertion were sentenced to
be branded with the letter “D” on the right thigh, to have
their heads shaved, and be drummed out of the service of the
United States with strong halters around their necks.</p>
<p>In the early 1850’s a traveler coming from the Northwest
left an interesting picture of Fort Gibson: The Verdigris
River forded, “another ride of an hour or more brought us to
the Neosho (Grand River); this forded, we ride into Fort Gibson.
This is a pretty place. There is the fort itself, with its
blockhouses, the palisades with their heavy wooden gates,
the stables on a hill nearby, the quarters of the dragoons in
a former day and their look-out, the campus outside the fort,
a plot of ground elevated above the river, having on two sides
the houses of the officers, the chapel and schoolhouse, the
government store, and all newly whitewashed. In this enclosure
was a little burying ground, carefully protected and
tastefully adorned with trees and shrubs. We pass out into
the Cherokee country by a large gate, near which is a store
having one entrance from the fort, and another from the
Indian country. Around this door a great number of horses
were tied while their riders were within, some with articles
to barter for goods, others endeavoring to purchase by giving
a lien on the annuity which will come next year, which annuity
may be sold or gambled away to several other parties, all
of whom will be at the council to claim it when it at length
arrives.”</p>
<p>Fort Gibson was still a young fort when it was discovered
that the green logs of which the houses were built were
rapidly decaying and constant repairs were required to make
them habitable. It was a sickly place and the great number
of deaths which occurred there gave it the name of the charnel
house of the army. From the time of its founding to December
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
8, 1835, eleven and a half years, 561 privates and
9 officers had died at the post. During the years 1834 and
1835 the deaths numbered 293 privates and 6 officers. In
the summertime, in order to avoid the miasmic breezes carrying
disease from the surrounding swamps and canebrakes,
detachments of troops were ordered to camp on the hill
above, or seven miles east on Bayou Manard at a place
known as Clark’s Springs, where at one time the Cherokee
agency, and later the home known as the McLain place, were
situated.</p>
<p>Probably no fort in the West exerted a greater influence
for the civilization of the surrounding country than did Fort
Gibson, and this became the purpose of its maintenance for
many years. With the appointment of the Stokes Indian Commission
in 1832, efforts were made to bring representatives
of the wild tribes to Fort Gibson for the purpose of making
treaties with them and impressing them with the sovereignty
of the United States; it was hoped that they would conform
their conduct accordingly and become friends of the whites
and of the Indian immigrants from the East who were to be
the new owners of the Indian Territory. Ellsworth’s efforts
in 1832, when Irving accompanied him, failed to accomplish
this result. In 1833 another expedition set out from Fort Gibson
commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James Many. In his
command were two select companies of the Seventh Infantry
and three companies of Rangers commanded by captains
Bean, Ford, and Boone, the latter Nathan Boone, son of the
famous Daniel. They went as far as the country on the Washita,
Blue, and Red rivers, but returned empty-handed after
suffering tremendous hardships.</p>
<p>The third effort to make contact with these Western Indians
was successfully carried out in 1834, by what became
known as the famous Dragoon Expedition. General Henry
Leavenworth arrived at Fort Gibson April 28 of that year and
assumed command of the post, which he held until June 12
when he departed in command of the expedition. This expedition
included also Colonel Henry Dodge, Colonel Stephen
Watts Kearney, and Major R. B. Mason. Jefferson Davis, a
lieutenant a few years out of West Point, was in command
of one company. This train of five hundred mounted troops,
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
a large number of white-covered baggage wagons, and seventy
head of beeves made an imposing procession. It was accompanied
by eleven Osage, eight Cherokee, six Delaware,
and seven Seneca Indians who went along to serve as guides,
hunters, interpreters, and as representatives of their respective
nations. They crossed the Arkansas River below the mouth
of Grand River, passed over the prairies near the site of the
future Muskogee, traveled southwest to the mouth of the
Washita River, then northwest, where they visited the site of
a Comanche village at the western end of the Wichita Mountains.</p>
<p>This was a disastrous expedition which resulted in the
deaths of nearly 150 men from disease and the effects of
excessive hot weather and poor water upon the unseasoned
and undisciplined soldiers lately recruited from private life
in the North and East. Included among the casualties of this
expedition was that of General Leavenworth, who died July
21 near the Washita River.</p>
<p>However, they did succeed in bringing back to Fort Gibson
representatives of the Kiowa, Wichita, and Waco tribes,
and after their return invitations were extended to all the
Indians within reach to attend a grand council at the post—Choctaws,
Cherokees, Creeks, Senecas, Osages, Delawares,
and others. Here, on September 2, 1834, began one of the
most interesting and important Indian councils ever held in
the country. On this occasion every effort was made to impress
the wild Indians who had never made a treaty with the
United States and make them understand the changed political
condition of the country. There were 150 Indians participating
in the council, and with their numerous women and
children, tepees and tents, they made one of the most picturesque
scenes ever witnessed at any army post.</p>
<p>Governor Stokes and the army officers who attended
did not have authority at this time to enter into a treaty,
but, with the potent influence of Colonel A. P. Chouteau,
who participated in the council, the commissioners secured
an agreement with the wild Indians to meet in treaty council
the following year. And so the plans which were launched
and carried out at Fort Gibson resulted in a treaty council
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
begun August 24, 1835, at Fort Mason on the Canadian
River near the present Purcell, Oklahoma, where was negotiated
the first treaty ever entered into by a number of these
western tribes.</p>
<p>In 1837 members of the Kiowa, Apache, and Tawakoni
tribes were induced to send representatives to Fort Gibson,
where on May 26 another important treaty, the first with
these Indians, was negotiated. These treaties gave assurance
of peace on the part of the Indians and guarantees of
safe passage for the traders over the Santa Fe route.</p>
<p>After the return of the Dragoon Expedition there were a
number of resignations of young officers who were thoroughly
tired of frontier service. An amusing incident growing out
of the tension between them resulted in a charge of insubordination
against Lieutenant Jefferson Davis by Major R. B.
Mason, followed by a court martial of the young officer at
Fort Gibson. The court found him guilty but attached no
criminality to the facts, and the judgment was that he be
acquitted. While the records and decision were being considered
by General E. P. Gaines, commander of the Southwestern
Military Department at Memphis, Tennessee, Lieutenant
Davis resigned from the army and went to Kentucky,
where he met and married Sarah Knox, the daughter of
General Zachary Taylor, whom he had wooed when he was
serving under her father at Fort Crawford on the upper
Mississippi River.</p>
<p>This statement, based on the life of Davis written by his
widow, and other authentic accounts, disposes of the romantic
but wholly fictitious yarn that Davis and his bride eloped
from Fort Gibson; equally apocryphal is a house nearby that
formerly was pointed out by the credulous as the “Jeff Davis
house,” since during the period of scarcely more than a year
that young Lieutenant Davis served there, he and the other
members of the Dragoons did not live in a house but were
quartered in tents half a mile from the fort.</p>
<p>At Fort Gibson were planned and launched other important
military expeditions among the wild Indians to the
west that made possible the negotiation of numerous essential
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
treaties with these tribes. A number of picturesque Indian
councils were held at the fort, with representatives of
many tribes from large areas of the West and Southwest
participating. These councils and negotiations exerted a profound
influence over the country, and Fort Gibson became
known far and wide as the source of important information
concerning this remote country. The early newspapers of the
East consequently carried a Fort Gibson date line more often
than that of any other place west of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>This ancient fort performed a multitude of other services
in connection with the civilization of this western country.
Through the years numerous military escorts were provided
for the protection of parties engaged in exploring meandering
streams and surveying boundaries of the lands occupied
by different Indian tribes, pursuant to treaties made from
time to time. In the effort to prevent the introduction of whiskey
into the Indian country, detachments frequently were sent
out from the fort to seize shipments of that contraband or
arrest and remove across the line whiskey peddlers who were
engaged in this unlawful activity; others were employed
either on land or in boats in patrolling the Arkansas River
for the same purpose.</p>
<p>The commandant at the fort was frequently called upon
by the authorities in Washington to aid parents or other relatives
living in Texas in the rescue of children captured in
raids by Kiowa and Comanche Indians. Emissaries were sent
out to bring their captive children to the fort, where a ransom
was effected and the children turned over to grateful
relatives.</p>
<p>From several points of view Fort Gibson enjoyed a unique
association with the growth of the army. In 1832 a call was
made for six companies of mounted troops known as Rangers
for service in the Black Hawk War in Illinois. Before the
companies had all been recruited the orders were changed,
and the Rangers were directed to proceed to Fort Gibson to
aid in preparing that country for the reception of the tribes
about to be emigrated from the East. The company commanded
by Captain Jesse Bean was the first to reach the fort,
and they went on the scouting tour, already mentioned, that
was accompanied by Washington Irving.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>The next year it was decided to discontinue the Ranger
organization and merge the six companies with the regiment
of Dragoons authorized that year by Congress. Major
Henry Dodge headed this regiment, Major Stephen Watts
Kearney was lieutenant colonel, and Captain Richard B.
Mason was appointed major. Five companies were recruited
and concentrated at Jefferson Barracks. After a proud send-off
by the citizens of St. Louis, they departed for Fort Gibson
where they arrived on December 17, 1834. They were
not quartered in the fort but had their own reservation on
land about half a mile south of it, and for a time lived in
tents. This regiment began its distinguished service by the
tragic expedition of that year which left so many of its members
in unmarked graves along the route, and in the little
cemeteries around the fort. They were accompanied by
George Catlin, the artist, who not only painted many portraits
of the Indians he saw, but wrote an interesting account
of the experiences of the regiment.</p>
<p>One company of this regiment did not go on this celebrated
expedition because it was engaged, under Captain
Clifton Wharton, in escorting a company of traders on the
Santa Fe Trail as far as the Spanish boundary. In the summer
of 1836 three troops of the Dragoon regiment, with six
companies of the Seventh Infantry, marched from Fort Gibson
to Nachitoches to aid the Texans in resisting what was
thought to be an impending attack by a large force of Mexicans.
The peril did not materialize and the troops returned
to Fort Gibson after an arduous campaign of several months
involving a march of a month each way. During their absence,
and due to an exaggerated alarm of war with Mexico;
several hundred men in Arkansas were mustered in as
volunteers and remained in camp at Fort Gibson for months.</p>
<p>Again, in 1837, a company under Captain Eustace
Trenor escorted Colonel A. P. Chouteau to his trading house
near the present Purcell, Oklahoma, where he called the wild
Indians to a conference in an effort to counteract the machinations
of the emissaries from Mexico and Texas who were
trying to enlist them in their respective controversies.</p>
<p>And in 1839 a detachment of Dragoons commanded by
Lieutenant James M. Bowman escorted the famous trading
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
expedition headed by Dr. Josiah Gregg to the limits of the
United States on the way to Santa Fe and Chihuahua. Captain
Nathan Boone headed a command of Dragoons that
left Fort Gibson May 14, 1843, and followed an interesting
route over the Santa Fe Trail and through the country west
of this post in order to afford protection to traders from
Texas. The Dragoons continued to police the West until this
service was interrupted by the Mexican War, in which it distinguished
itself in several important battles.</p>
<p>Frequent reports came to Fort Gibson of the hostilities of
the Plains Indians against the people of Texas, along with
rumors that the Mexicans were aiding and abetting them. Requests
were made for the authorities at Fort Gibson to aid in
making peace with these Indians on both sides of the Red
River. The Secretary of War directed this to be done and in
March, 1843, Cherokee Agent Pierce Butler left the post, and
with an escort attended a council on Tawakoni Creek in
Texas, where, however, nothing definite was accomplished.
Another effort was made in the fall when Butler was accompanied
by eighty men commanded by Colonel Harney. Again
the Indians were elusive and non-committal. The next summer
in 1844, another effort was made when Captain Nathan
Boone, with a company of the First Dragoons, left the post
September 25 and went to the rendezvous in Texas; but the
Indians had left when Boone arrived and he returned to Fort
Gibson unsuccessful, after an absence of six weeks. A fourth
attempt was made when in January, 1846, Governor Butler
departed from Fort Gibson with a large company of civilian
hunters and adventurers and representatives of the Creek,
Cherokee, Chickasaw, and Seminole tribes. Butler was finally
successful, and on May 15, 1846, at Council Springs, Texas,
negotiated a treaty of peace with the Comanche, Anadarko,
Caddo, Wichita, Waco, and other western tribes that brought
a sense of security to the frontier settlers of Texas.</p>
<p>Officers and men went from Fort Gibson to take their
places in the war with Mexico; the veteran commander Colonel
Gustavus Loomis was the last high ranking officer to
leave, when he departed in February, 1848, for his post in
Mexico City. After that many war veterans who had seen
service in Mexico became part of the military establishment
at Fort Gibson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Captain Braxton Bragg, who was to become a celebrated
commander in the Confederate Army, arrived at Fort Gibson
from St. Louis on October 31, 1853, at the head of Company
C of the Third Artillery and assumed command of the post,
which he retained until June 20 of the following year.</p>
<p>Indian hostilities were harassing a large extent of the surrounding
country and Colonel Pitcairn Morrison was ordered
out from Fort Gibson with three companies of the Seventh Infantry,
numbering 235 officers and men. They left in June
and went out over the Santa Fe Trail in Kansas to Fort Mann
and Bent’s Fort, where Morrison held councils with the chiefs
of the Kiowa, Comanche, Arapaho, Apache, and Cheyenne
Indians. He then returned and arrived at Fort Gibson October
15. And so the policing of the western country from Fort Gibson
went on and on.</p>
<p>Soon after Morrison’s return, the post entertained the
Second Cavalry just created by Congress, which was on its way
to Fort Belknap, its station in Texas, to police that country
against the Indians. They left Jefferson Barracks near St.
Louis October 27, 1855, and a month later arrived at Fort
Gibson, where they remained a few days to shoe their horses
and give them a much needed rest. This regiment was commanded
by Colonel Albert Sidney Johnston; other officers of
the regiment were Colonel E. V. Sumner, Colonel J. E. Johnston,
Colonel W. H. Emory, Delos B. Sackett, J. E. B. Stuart,
and other men who became known to history. Colonel Robert
E. Lee was second in command of the regiment, George H.
Thomas was a major, Edmund Kirby Smith was a captain, and
John B. Hood a lieutenant.</p>
<p>After the Mexican War the First Dragoons continued as
regulators of the wild Indians throughout the West. On August
3, 1861, its designation was changed to the First United
States Cavalry, and it served with distinction during the Civil
War. For the next seventy-one years this veteran organization
maintained its fine traditions. Less than two years ago,
after a hundred years of service in the saddle, this organization
ceased to exist as a mounted regiment and was removed
by gas power from Marfa, Texas to Fort Knox, Kentucky.</p>
<p>Fort Gibson was a haven of refuge for many classes of
people. When the emigration of the Creeks began in 1828 the
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
first arrivals settled on the Verdigris and Arkansas rivers
near the fort to enjoy the protection it afforded against the
wild Indians occupying their lands to the west.</p>
<p>In 1836 the remainder of the Creek Indians were forcibly
removed from their homes in Alabama. After appalling
suffering and many deaths on the way, their conductor
brought them to Fort Gibson. Ten thousand of them, cold,
destitute, and broken spirited, were encamped through the
winter around the fort where they were given food enough to
sustain life until spring, when they could be removed to the
land intended for them. Later, when the Seminole Indians
were brought as prisoners from their old home in Florida,
they were landed from the boats at Fort Gibson. Several
thousand of them were established in camps in this locality
where rations were issued to them; some of them remained
several years before they could be induced to remove to the
lands intended for them. At one time a few hundred Seminole
Negroes were located at the same place. They had surrendered
to General Jesup in Florida, and claimed that they
had been promised emancipation in return for their surrender.
Some of the wealthier Seminoles claimed them as slaves,
and they were retained in the custody of the garrison while
their status was being investigated and determined by the
authorities in Washington. They were employed in 1845 and
1846 in the construction of the stone buildings at the fort.</p>
<p>Some of the Creek immigrants who had ventured to locate
on their lands in the more remote part of their country
near the present site of Holdenville, in 1843 became involved
with a band of Wichita Indians, four of whom were killed
by the Creeks. A call for help was sent in to the settlements
and a general alarm spread over the Creek country. The
Creeks became panic stricken, and women and children came
flocking into Fort Gibson. The Creek agent and some of the
traders on the Verdigris also rushed to the post for protection.
Captain Boone was sent with his company to the mouth of
Little River and returned a week later with the report that the
alarm was unfounded.</p>
<p>Fort Gibson was employed also as a base for the establishment
of other garrisons; thus in 1833 Fort Smith was
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
temporarily re-established by a detachment of the Seventh
Infantry from Fort Gibson commanded by Captain John Stuart.
Two years later this detachment was again removed up
the river thirteen miles to make Fort Coffee, to which point
a road was constructed from Fort Gibson. In 1838 they were
removed from Fort Coffee to create, near the Arkansas line,
an establishment called Fort Wayne, another subsidiary to
Fort Gibson. In the summer of 1834, under the direction of
General Leavenworth, Camp Arbuckle at the mouth of the
Cimarron River and Fort Holmes at the mouth of Little River
were established, and the necessary buildings erected by detachments
of the Seventh Infantry sent out from Fort Gibson.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1841 a detachment from Fort Gibson
commanded by Captain B. D. Moore was dispatched to select
a location for a fort on the Washita River; it was visited the
next year by General Zachary Taylor who approved the site
for the fort, which he named Fort Washita.</p>
<p>Details from Fort Gibson were engaged also in the construction
of a number of important roads; thus in 1826 Captain
Pierce M. Butler and Lieutenant James L. Dawson surveyed
a military road from Fort Gibson to Fort Smith, the
first planned road construction within the limits of the present
Oklahoma. Other details built the road from the post to
the site of Camp Arbuckle at the mouth of the Cimarron, and
another to the mouth of the Washita River.</p>
<p>The unhealthful location of Fort Gibson and the appalling
death rate there resulted in ceaseless agitation for the
abandonment of the old log fort and the removal of the garrison
to a more healthful situation. The people of Arkansas
had never given up hope that the garrison might be returned
to them. When they were admitted into the Union in 1836
they had sufficient influence to secure the passage of a bill
by Congress providing for the removal of the post to that new
state. A commission of army officers was appointed to select
a new site but they definitely reported against the wisdom of
changing the location of the fort which, they said, was greatly
needed where it was; but they said that if it were to be removed,
the site selected should be at Fort Coffee, still within
the limits of the Indian Territory, about thirteen miles up the
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
Arkansas River from Fort Smith. As this did not meet the
wishes of the people of Arkansas the matter was dropped.</p>
<p>It was necessary to make constant repairs on the decaying
buildings; in 1843 a sawmill was set up at the post for cutting
lumber with which to do this work, and a contract was
let to Thomas Rogers for the delivery there of 2,000 pine logs
which he was to cut on the Spavinaw and float down Grand
River.</p>
<p>An order was made the next summer requiring all troops
to appear on all parades and drills in white trousers, and in
white jackets on all drills. First fatigue call was to be at 5:30
in the morning and guard mount an hour and a half later.</p>
<p>Continued agitation for the construction of more substantial
quarters for the garrison resulted in an appropriation by
Congress, and on July 17, 1845, General Thomas S. Jesup,
quartermaster of the army, arrived at Fort Gibson to direct
the construction of new buildings of stone on the hill above,
and on the slope between it and the old log fort. Work on the
new structures was soon started and by March 1846, a barracks
for two companies had progressed above the second
floor and timbers for both floors and piazzas were laid.</p>
<p>When the work had reached this stage it was stopped by
the burning of the saw mill at the fort with the loss of mill,
lumber, and tools. By 1855, the only building completed was
the commissary, which is to be seen across the present street
from the barracks. The walls of the partially constructed barracks
stood for more than ten years, and still marked the unfinished
plans of the army when the post was abandoned. The
other structures of the fort at that time were principally log
barracks, although a substantial number of those originally
standing had been destroyed by a disastrous fire in December
1854.</p>
<p>The Cherokee people had been agitating for several
years for the removal of Fort Gibson from their country in
order that they might enjoy the use of the boat landing which
was claimed to be the only good landing place giving access
to the interior of the Cherokee Nation. Their argument was
strengthened by the fact that, as the frontier had advanced,
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
newer forts had supplanted Fort Gibson in usefulness and
strategic location.</p>
<p>The Cherokees were finally successful; the order to
abandon the fort was issued June 8, 1857, and within the
month was substantially executed. The fort and reservation
were turned over to the Cherokee Nation, and the Cherokee
Council, on November 6, 1857, passed an act creating the
town of Kee-too-wah upon what had been the military reservation,
and provided for the sale to Cherokee citizens of lots
therein.</p>
<p>The Civil War brought further changes to the old fort.
For a time in possession of the Confederate Army, it was
afterwards regained by the Union side and on April 5, 1863,
the whole hill was reoccupied by three Cherokee regiments,
four companies of Kansas cavalry, and Hopkins’ Battery of
Volunteers, an aggregate of 3,150 men, with four field pieces
and two mountain howitzers.</p>
<p>A main works embraced fifteen to twenty acres with
angles and facings; from this extended a line of earthworks
about a quarter of a mile in length, the whole defense being
considered strong enough to resist a force of 20,000 men. To
this work was, for a time, given the name of Fort Blunt, in
compliment to Major General James G. Blunt, then commanding
the district of the frontier.</p>
<p>General Blunt had made a forced march from Kansas to
Fort Gibson and on the night of July 16, 1863, crossed the
Arkansas River, proceeded down the Texas Road, and the
next morning attacked the Confederate command under
General Douglas H. Cooper at Honey Springs, near the site
of the present Oktaha, south of Muskogee. By this engagement,
the most important battle in the Indian Territory during
the war, the Union forces succeeded in preventing a union of
Cooper’s forces with those of General William L. Cabell,
coming from Fort Smith, and the probable recapture of Fort
Gibson by the Confederates.</p>
<p>After this battle the strength of Fort Gibson was increased
until on July 31 it aggregated 5,204, and on August
31 there were 6,014 troops at the garrison, with eighteen
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
field pieces. Being the most important fortified point in the
Territory, it served as headquarters for the military operations
in this region during the remainder of the Civil War
and played a conspicuous part in strengthening the hands of
the loyal elements among the tribes. The name of Blunt was
officially attached to the post until December 31, 1863,
when it was dropped in favor of the old name, Fort Gibson.</p>
<p>After the Union forces took possession of the fort it was
surrounded by several thousand destitute Indian and Negro
refugees who remained there for protection and for the food
that was issued to them in small quantities. The multitude
of people thus congregated presented a problem to the commandant.
Some of them put in small crops under the protection
of the guns of the fort; they would have gone farther
away to their homes but for the fear that they would be raided
by predatory bands from both sides, ranging over the
country.</p>
<p>A detachment of regular troops from the first battalion
of the Tenth United States Infantry in command of Major
James M. Mulligan, on February 17, 1866, relieved the Sixty-second
Illinois Volunteers then constituting the garrison. The
post remained garrisoned under the name of Fort Gibson by
four companies of the Sixth Infantry until September 30,
1871; it was then vacated by the command under General
W. B. Hazen and broken up as a military post; there was left
only a guard composed of a small detachment of the Sixth
Infantry for the quartermaster’s department, which temporarily
occupied the post as a depot for such transportation
and other facilities as were necessary to enable paymasters
and other officers to communicate with Fort Sill.</p>
<p>Beginning with that of 1811, nearly all the classes of
the United States Military Academy at West Point were represented
among the more than one hundred graduates who
were stationed at Fort Gibson from time to time prior to the
Civil War. Every class after 1819 had from three to ten graduates
who served in later years at that famous post. Many
graduates were sent from West Point direct to Fort Gibson
to get their first taste of army life and frontier experience.
Eight of the class of 1842 came for their frontier service to
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
this fort from whence they were engaged in protecting the
Santa Fe traders.</p>
<p>Except for short intervals, General Arbuckle commanded
at Fort Gibson for 17 years until 1841 when, because of
the dilapidated condition of the buildings there, he removed
his department headquarters (but not the garrison), to Fort
Smith. Soon afterward the command was given to General
Zachary Taylor. When Taylor departed for service in Mexico,
Arbuckle was returned to the command of Fort Gibson and
remained there through the years of trouble and turmoil of
his Indian neighbors of the Cherokee Nation, with whom he
was more or less involved.</p>
<p>Fort Gibson was garrisoned by detachments of the Seventh
Infantry from its inception in 1824 to February 7, 1839,
when the troops left for service in Florida and were replaced
by the Fourth Infantry that had arrived the day before, after
a long, weary march from that remote Seminole battleground.
For a time three companies of the Third Infantry served at
the fort until the spring of 1840. The next year General Arbuckle
was relieved of his command and it was transferred
for a time to Colonel Alexander Cummings of the Fourth Infantry.</p>
<p>In 1843 the post was garrisoned by three troops of Dragoons
and four companies of the Sixth Infantry under the
command of Colonel William Davenport. Another well-known
officer who was in command of the post in 1850 was
General W. G. Belknap of the Fifth Infantry. Belknap and
Arbuckle died in 1851.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the Civil War returned Fort Gibson
to the unimportant status to which it was reduced by its
abandonment in 1857. For years, however, the large number
of substantial buildings of the post were found useful from
time to time. It was reoccupied in July, 1872, by two companies
of the Tenth Cavalry under Colonel Benjamin H.
Grierson who was sent there to cope with the lawless element
attracted by the movement of the railroad camps engaged in
building the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railroad from the
Kansas line to the Red River.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>After the brief stay of the Tenth Cavalry a company of
the Sixth Cavalry and a detachment of the Fifth Infantry
were assigned to the post to help police the country, with
Lieutenant Thomas M. Woodruff of the Fifth Infantry in
command. They were mainly occupied in aiding the Cherokee
agent in resisting the encroachment of intruding white men
unlawfully seeking to settle in the Cherokee Nation. In order
to maintain communication with the outside world a
telegraph line was constructed to the fort from the railroad
at Gibson Station. Men engaged in cutting poles for the line
were crossing the Grand River on a ferry flatboat on April
20, 1874, when in the middle of the river, by awkward handling
of the front guy rope, the boat was allowed to swing
broadside to the current; this caused it to fill with water and
sink. As a result six soldiers of the Fifth Infantry and the
Sixth Cavalry and one civilian drowned.</p>
<p>Later, in 1879, a detachment of the Twenty-second Infantry
under the command of Major A. S. Hough was stationed
at the post endeavoring to aid the civilian authorities
in suppressing a gang of forty or fifty thieves and desperadoes
that had been plundering and terrorizing the country,
particularly in the Chickasaw Nation and on the Potawatomi
reservation. To this duty Hough had been ordered by General
Sheridan.</p>
<p>During the Creek trouble of 1883, called the Green
Peach War, part of the Twentieth Infantry was stationed at
Fort Gibson and detachments were sent out to Muskogee,
Eufaula, and Okmulgee to police the country. One detachment
went to the Sac and Fox agency and captured several
hundred Creeks who were brought to Fort Gibson where they
were detained for a time and given protection from the hostile
faction. The Adjutant General on August 22, 1890, issued
a final order for the abandonment of the fort, directing
the withdrawal of the troops and disposition of the public
property there. In 1899, when the little disturbance greatly
exaggerated by the name of the “Snake Uprising” caused
some discussion, a company of the Ninth Infantry was for a
short time stationed at the old post.</p>
<p>For a number of years the Cherokee agency was conducted
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
at Fort Gibson, first by Montford Stokes, former governor
of North Carolina, and by his successor, Pierce M.
Butler, former governor of South Carolina, who left Fort Gibson
to return to his home and organize the Palmetto Regiment
which he was commanding in the Mexican War when
he was killed August 20, 1847, at Churubusco.</p>
<p>Even after the removal of the agency the old fort was
the scene of amazing activities during some of the payments
to the Cherokees, notably the payment of 1852 and that of
1894. These were festive occasions when there were nearly
as many white men as Indians, come to take what advantage
they might from the large amount of currency in circulation.
Many of them were creditors of the Indians who had
come to collect their dues; others were vendors of every conceivable
sort of merchandise calculated to tempt the Indians
to part with their suddenly acquired wealth. The payment of
over a million dollars in 1894 was made in the old barracks
building. The money was piled on a table in front of the
clerks, while a dozen armed Indians stood guard on either
side, and the Indians came up as their names were called
and received their shares.</p>
<p>Among the many interesting visitors to Fort Gibson was
the picturesque Sam Houston, who came in 1829 and established
himself about three miles northwest of the post at a
place which he called Wigwam Neosho. Here he was in close
touch with the fort, the Creek agency, and the trading post
on the Verdigris River an equal distance to the northwest,
where he carried on his intrigues with the Indians, and drank
and played poker with the army officers and traders. There
he lived and enjoyed the solace of his pretty Cherokee companion,
Diana Rogers, until 1832 when he left for his adventures
in Texas. It may have been in a measure the recollection
of Houston and his companionship that later influenced
the movement of troops from Fort Gibson for the
relief of beleaguered Texans.</p>
<p>One officer of outstanding interest who served at Fort
Gibson was the Frenchman, B. L. E. Bonneville of the Seventh
Infantry. In 1824, while he was a lieutenant, he secured a
leave of absence and as secretary accompanied General Lafayette
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
to France after his triumphal tour of the United
States. Eight years later he secured another leave and made
a protracted expedition in the Rocky Mountains. He kept
voluminous notes of his experiences, which were purchased
by Washington Irving who made them into the fascinating
book, <b>The Adventures of Captain Bonneville</b>.</p>
<p>In 1888 Colonel J. J. Coppinger of the Eighteenth Infantry
was in command at Fort Gibson, and in March made
an inventory of the buildings at the post together with a general
description of them. He reported seven stone buildings
and ten frame, nearly all large, substantial buildings which
ranged in condition from fair to good.</p>
<p>These buildings fell into private ownership and most of
them were razed for the material that was in them. Four of
the stone buildings are standing. The barracks was originally
23 by 154 feet in size, containing ten rooms for the accommodation
of two companies of Infantry. The north half of this
building was torn down and the material used in the construction
of a house.</p>
<p>The Oklahoma Historical Society purchased the remaining
south half of the barracks building, the stone ammunition
building, and the great brick oven, together with the
land on which they stand. Considerable money was expended
in the restoration of these buildings, and the barracks
building is now occupied by a custodian and his family who
will show the place to visitors. The most picturesque exhibit
at Fort Gibson is the reconstructed log stockade built on the
site of the first log fort. This work was directed by a commission
created by the State of Oklahoma.</p>
<p>The best-preserved relic of the old fort is the commanding
officer’s residence, facing what was the parade ground
of the fort. Colonel William Babcock Hazen came to command
the fort in January 1871. He brought there his bride
who, as his widow, was later to become the wife of the Spanish-American
hero, Admiral George Dewey. Lieutenant Colonel
John Joseph Coppinger, commandant of the fort, occupied
the building in 1886 with his family. James G. Blaine,
father of Mrs. Coppinger, visited his daughter in this residence
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
and was confined there at one time by illness. The cornerstone
of the building bears the inscription: “Erected A. D.
1867, A. S. Kimball, Capt. A. Q. M. U. S.”</p>
<p>The story of Fort Gibson is an epic of the prairies; a tale
of the winning of the great Southwest; an account of the conquest
of the fleet warriors of the plains; a narrative of the
security of trade and contact with old Santa Fe and California.
Fort Gibson saw the beginning and the end of the keelboat
and the whole career of the river steamboat.</p>
<p>Unknown to the present generation, the old fort and the
few relics of that venerable establishment that have escaped
the hand of the vandal should still have a claim on our consideration.
Around them cluster associations with the past
and reminders of early attempts at the civilization of this
western country. The activities of this frontier post, the toil
and hardship, sickness and death endured there, the picturesqueness
of its population, the pageantry of its activities
and functions—all these are calculated to stir the imagination
of the beholder and stimulate in him an interest in the
fascinating history of this country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c1">APPENDIX I
<br><span class="small"><i class="large">National Cemetery</i></span></h2>
<p>There were several small cemeteries around Fort Gibson
in which the dead were buried from the earliest days of
the fort. The number of interments was increased to such an
extent during the Civil War that more space was required,
and in 1869 the National Cemetery was established on land
that was originally part of the military reservation of Fort
Gibson. After the abandonment of the fort, the reservation
was transferred to the Department of the Interior on February
11, 1891, a parcel of seven acres being reserved for
cemeterial purposes.</p>
<p>On August 6, 1872, William W. Belknap, Secretary of
War, gave instructions to have the remains of his father,
General William Goldsmith Belknap, removed from Fort
Washita, where they were interred in 1851, to the cemetery
at Keokuk, Iowa, the home of the Secretary. At the same
time he directed the quartermaster general to arrange for the
removal of the remains of other soldiers and their families
found at Fort Washita, Fort Towson and Fort Arbuckle, to
the National Cemetery at Fort Gibson. Bids were advertised
for, and a contract was let to P. J. Byrne of Fort Gibson, who
succeeded in removing the remains of forty-six persons in
1872; only two of them, however, were definitely known to
be soldiers. Owing to the careless manner in which the men
who served at these remote posts had been buried, and the
fact that fires had been permitted to run through the cemeteries
and burn off all wooden headboards, and the difficulty
of finding other marks of identification in the graves, or indeed,
of finding the remains and the boxes containing them
in such condition that they could be removed at all, instructions
were given to abandon further removal. However, information
was later acquired of forty-six additional graves at
Fort Washita: fifty-four at Fort Arbuckle, and eighteen at
Big Sandy Creek on the Fort Smith and Fort Arbuckle road.
Efforts were then renewed, and another contractor undertook
to remove the remains to the Fort Gibson National
Cemetery but this effort proved abortive also.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>In 1873 it was reported to the office of the Adjutant
General at Washington that the bodies of one hundred and
twenty-five soldiers killed in the Battle of the Washita were
buried on that battlefield. This again stimulated interest in
the subject of removal, and the visitor will see in the Officers’
Circle in the National Cemetery the grave of Major Joel H.
Elliott of the Seventh Infantry, killed on November 27, 1868,
at the Battle of the Washita.</p>
<p>The removal of remains from all these burial places was
attended with much difficulty because of the lack of identifying
marks. It was impossible to determine whether they
were removing soldiers or civilians, and the whole undertaking
was attended with much confusion. It appeared that during
the Civil War a large number of Confederates died and
were buried near Fort Washita. The correspondence relating
to the subject would indicate that removal of the dead from
this cemetery was limited to those known to have been in
the service of the Union Army, and the Confederate dead
were probably not disturbed.</p>
<p>The result was summarized in a report of December 31,
1893, which accounted for graves in the National Cemetery
at Fort Gibson, of 231 known to be soldiers and 2,212 whose
identity and service were unknown. Of the comparatively few
who are identified by inscriptions on monuments, the greatest
number are to be seen within what is known as the Officers’
Circle. Among these is Flora, the young Cherokee wife
of Lieutenant Daniel H. Rucker, who died at Fort Gibson
June 26, 1845. Her husband survived her to become in later
years Quartermaster General of the United States Army.
John Decatur, brother of Stephen Decatur, died on November
12, 1832, while a sutler at Fort Gibson. Lieutenant John
W. Murray of the West Point Class of 1830, of the Seventh
Infantry, was killed on February 14, 1831, by being thrown
from his horse. Murray’s classmate, Lieutenant James West,
died at Fort Gibson on September 28, 1834.</p>
<p>On May 27, 1831, Lieutenant Frederick Thomas of the
Seventh Infantry, a West Point graduate of 1825, was drowned
in the Arkansas River. His classmate, Lieutenant Benjamin
W. Kinsman, also of the Seventh Infantry, died May 14,
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
1832. Lieutenant Thomas C. Brockway, a graduate of West
Point of the class of 1828, died at Fort Gibson, September
28, 1831. Among those removed from Fort Towson were
West Point graduates of the class of 1826, Lieutenants Charles
L. C. Minor and Alexander G. Baldwin, both of the Fifth
Infantry, who died at Fort Towson in 1833 and 1835 respectively,
and Lieutenant James H. Taylor of the Third Infantry,
who was drowned near Fort Towson in the Cositot
River, in 1835. Also in the Officers’ Circle is the monument
of Captain Billy Bowlegs, the celebrated Seminole warrior,
who served in the Union Army and died during the Civil War,
and who is buried in another part of the cemetery.</p>
<p>General John Nicks (also buried in this cemetery) acquired
his title from the appointment, by the Governor of
Arkansas Territory, as commanding general of the Arkansas
militia. He was later sutler at Fort Gibson, where he died
December 31, 1831. He was survived by his widow, Sallie
Nicks, who continued to “sutle” at the post. Sallie was a
popular young widow whose charms were enhanced by the
fact that the estate left by the General was valued at $20,000.
When Washington Irving visited the post in 1832, he
recorded in his notebook that several of the officers at the
post paid court to her, and the quartermaster serenaded her
so often and so vigorously that he disturbed the sleep of
others, and made himself a good deal of a nuisance in the
post. According to Irving, General William Clark and Colonel
Arbuckle were both fascinated by the young widow, and a
civilian named Lewis paid such ardent court that all of the
officers united against him.</p>
<p>Sutlers were licensed to do business in the post, and there
was considerable rivalry for the privilege, as the profits were
tempting. At one time Sam Houston was an aspirant for the
position of sutler at Fort Gibson. During his absence in the
East on a political mission, he heard that General Nicks was
to be removed from his post as sutler, and on his way back to
Fort Gibson he wrote a letter to the Secretary of War, making
application for the post. Houston was returning with a
keelboat load of supplies for Wigwam Neosho, his little store
northwest of Fort Gibson. They included nine barrels of whiskey,
brandy, gin, rum, wine and other goods with which he
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
meant to stock the sutler’s store he intended to take over if
Nick’s removal should pave the way for his appointment.
However, after arriving at Fort Gibson and learning of the
gossip said to have emanated from Washington concerning
him, he indignantly withdrew his application with an excoriating
letter to the Secretary of War, obviously written while
he was drunk.</p>
<p>To one who wonders what care the soldiers at Fort Gibson
took of their personal appearance, a long inventory of
merchandise in the sutler’s store at Fort Gibson in 1845 will
be illuminating. The following is about one-sixth of the total
list. It was submitted to the commandant for the purpose of
establishing the prices at which these articles might be sold
to the soldiers:</p>
<p>Cigars, shaving boxes, round shaving soap, transparent
soap, flotant soap, chrystalline wash balls, whisker pomatum,
spontaneous compound, oleophane, bear’s oil, philocome,
fancy soap, perfume boxes, fancy cologne water, round
cologne water, farina cologne water, prevost cologne water,
red and white powder, sweeping brush, clamp brush, horse
brush, shoe brush, counter brush, hat brush, hair brush, wall
brush, cloth brush, shaving brush, teeth brush, ivory brush,
nail brush, violin strings, razor strops, mirrors, shirt butts,
cotton purses, silk purses, pencil cases, whalebone, suspenders,
snuff boxes, necklaces, fishing lines, guard chains,
flasks, thimbles, court plaisters, hooks and eyes, silk guards,
pocket combs, English combs, dressing combs.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
